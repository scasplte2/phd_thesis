ok, maybe I know how to explain the scarttering particle wavefunction

how do I now add the interaction field and the coupling to the new states?

How can I fughe talking about the excited state wavefunction?

I don't need any additional wavefunctions other than the ground state one since this is how I want to introduce scattering theory and the origin of the wavefunction

They kinda mention the
