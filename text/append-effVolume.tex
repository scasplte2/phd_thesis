\chapter{Concise derivation of effective volumes}
\label{app:effective_volumes}

The following derivation is meant to serve as a quick reference for finding the analytic form of the effective volumes for ultracold gases held in a optical dipole trap. This section follows the arguements presented by Mi's paper which considers and numerically evaluates the general case of power-law potentials and the corresponding density distribution at arbitrary temperatures less than the trap depth.

If instead one restricts to the experimentally reasonable conditions of high-$\eta$ (recall $\eta$ is the ratio of trap depth to sample temperature, $\eta=\epsilon_t/k_B T$) and harmonic trapping potentials, then a useful analytic expression can be found for the effective volumes of the gas.
