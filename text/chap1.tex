\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

The ability to engineer and manipulate quantum states lies at the heart of modern atomic physics experiments using ultracold gases \cite{Davis1995,Anderson1995,Bradley1995,DeMarco1999,Lang2008,Ni2008}. Two important tools for this pursuit are Feshbach resonances \cite{Chin2010,Kohler2006} and optical lattices \cite{Bloch2008}. This proposal will detail our recent work building and characterizing a three-dimension optical lattice for use with ultracold and quantum degenerate gases of neutral strontium. Furthermore, we will present the first experiment we hope to pursue with the optical lattice; the creation of Feshbach molecules using an optical Feshbach resonance. We will also briefly discuss other future plans such as the production of highly excited ground state Sr$_2$ dimers through adiabatic internal state transfer.

Should probably mention somewhere that this is long-range PA, in contrast to short-range stuff being explored now.

The experiments in this proposal will be realized using an ultracold gas of atomic strontium. Fig.\;\ref{fig:energy_level_diagram} shows all of the stable isotopes of strontium, their natural abundance, as well as their inter-particle scattering lengths. The isotopic differences in strontium have important implications for their use in certain experiments. For example, none of the bosonic isotopes of strontium ($^{88}$Sr, $^{86}$Sr, or $^{84}$Sr) display hyperfine structure since they have no nuclear spin, $\vec{I}=0$. However, the fermionic isotope $^{87}$Sr has a large nuclear spin, $\vec{I}=9/2$, which makes it an ideal candidate for exploring exotic phases of quantum magnetism \cite{Beverland2016,Cazalilla2014,Chen2015}. In the studies presented in this proposal, we are sensitive to the isotopic shifts of the bosonic photoassociation lines along the $^1S_0\!\rightarrow\!^3P_1$ transition as well as the various interspecies scattering lengths.
