\chapter{Photoassociation in ultracold gases}
\label{ch:chap3}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:pas_intro}

% Intro
This part needs to be brief and really should motivate the idea of PAS.

PA is not unique to atomic physics, chemists have been using light to interrogate molecular structure for a long time

%Usefulness
physicists molecule

PA can come in many forms (in a lattice, in a bulk gas, via dissociating molecules) Experimentally we observe PA by looking for trap loss \hl{doublon paper}.

There are multiple flavors of PAS. Can do one-photon or two-photon.

Can even be used to modify the scattering length of atoms through mixing of atomic eigenstates. 

%history
Pioneering work done in the early 90's used PA to interrogate the sturucture of interatomic potentials to deduce the scattering lengths between atoms.

a photoassociation experiment can be used to map the square of the scattering wave function in the ground electronic state at the Condon points corresponding to the different excited bound levels. \cite{Borkowski2009}
What about the history of scattering? 
Most of what we know about quantum mechanics comes from either scattering experiments of spectroscopy. 
Definitely need some BS about how simple scattering theory has been a hallmark of atomic physics and 
Photoassociation spectroscopy is an important field which relies on both of these properties.
 
% recent experiments
rabi oscilations between atomic and molecular condensates (cite ours and the lattice experiment that followed)

short-range PA
This work is focused on long-range PA but in recent years groups have also developed short-range PA techniques for the creation of rovibrational ground state molecules. These techniques rely heavily on favorable overlap integrals betwwen molecular wavefunctions and typically searching for favorable intermediate states is a pain (that is why our large FCF might be useful)

% Segue
While the general idea of photoassociation is incredibly straightforward, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the process requires discussion of several key topics related to the behavior of ultracold gases. \hl{fix this segue}
The photoassociation process is effected by the residual kinetic energy of the atoms, external potential energy from trapping potentials, and the internal potential energy due to inter-particle scattering between atoms.
In the following sections we will cover the statistical mechanics linking the atom temperature and distribution in parabolic potentials.
Next we'll move to cold collisions and see the importance of the scattering wavefunction and how external fields can lead to tunable properties.
Finally, we'll pull it all together and develop analytic expressions which can be used to fit spectral lineshapes and extract meaningful information from these experiments.

\section{Theoretical description of trapped bosonic gases} \label{sec:trapped_gases}

Additiona

This section will briefly discuss the 

Need to know the spatial and momentum distribution of atoms in the trap. Concerned with space as the liklihood of PA is dependent on the interatomic separation and and the overlap integral between wavefunctions plays a big role. Highest probability of excitation is near the Condon point \hl{citations?}

Momentum distribution needs to be known as this effects how the wavefunction looks as well as the distribution of energies within the cloud which can lead to line-broadening and asymmetric lineshapes

Essentailly first part of chapter 2 from Res

We need 

Since photoassociation is a two-body process, an accurate description of the spatial

This chapter will briefly cover the statistical mechanics of trapped atomic gases,
both both at thermal temperatures and at near-zero temperatures for bosons and fermions. In our experiment, we typically acquire data by imaging the atomic density profile either in-situ or after releasing the atoms and allowing them to freely expand for a variable time-of-flight (TOF). I will discuss the expected density profiles for these various regimes and the related fit functions that we use to extract physical information from our samples. To illustrate the properties of trapped atomic gases, let us first consider a system
in the grand canonical ensemble. For non-interacting particles at a temperature T, the average occupation of the state i with energy Ei is

Typically our samples have a fixed number of particles, N, so the chemical potential, $\mu$, is constrained such that

In the limit of large particle number we can describe the gas semi-classically asssuming that the occupation of the ground state is negligble.

The semi-classical distribution is defined such that the average number of particles in the phase-space volume dpdr is given by f(r, p)dpdr/(2$\pi$)3 and

\hl{check the equation numbers in pethick and smith}
Consider the number density of atoms per phase space volume $(2 \pi \hbar)^3$ integrated from $\epsilon > 0$
\begin{equation}
	n(\vec{r}) = \int \frac{d\vec{p}}{2\pi\hbar^3}\frac{1}{\exp(E_r(\vec{r} - \mu/k_BT) - 1}
\end{equation}
where we are neglecting the full quantum nature of the atoms and considering them as point masses with free particle energy $E_r(\vec{r}) = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(\vec{r})$

next we define the quantities 
\begin{equation}
x=\frac{p^2}{2mk_BT} \\
z(\vec{r}) = e^{\mu - V(\vec{r})/k_BT}
\end{equation}

\hl{define $\xi$}

then performing a change of variables and plugging into \hl{above eq} we find
	\begin{equation}
	n(\vec{r}) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi} \lambda_T^3}\int dx \frac{\sqrt{x}}{z^{-1}e^x-1}
	\end{equation}
where $\lambda_T = \sqrt{\frac{2 \pi \hbar^2}{m k_B T}}$ is the de Broglie wavelength \hl{cite}?. This integral is of a certain form and can be rewritten using \hl{cite Demarco pg 237 footnote}

\hl{need to put bound on these integrals from 0 to inf}
\hl{where does the 3/2 come from?}

	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	\int_0^{\inf}dx\frac{x^{\gamma-1}}{z^{-1}e^x-1} &= \sum_{n=1}^{\inf}\int_0^{\inf}dx x^{\gamma-1}e^{-nx}z^n \\
	&=\Gamma(\gamma)\text{Li}_{\gamma}[z]
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
where $\text{Li}_{\gamma}[z]$ is the polylogarithm function defined by \hl{cite something}
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:polylog_def}
	\text{Li}_{\gamma}[z] = \sum_{n=1}^{\inf}\frac{z^n}{n^{\gamma}}
	\end{equation}
This function is also known as the bose enhancement function \hl{cite ketterle} and describes the bunching of bosonic particles near degeneracy

Using this identity we can write the thermal distribution as
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	n(\vec{r}) &= \frac{\Li{\ssfrac{3}{2}}{z(\vec{r})}}{\lambda_T^3} \\
				 &= \frac{1}{\lambda_T^3}\Li{\ssfrac{3}{2}}{\exp{\mu-V(\vec{r})/k_BT}}
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}

For harmonic traps $V(\vec{r}) = \frac{m}{2}\displaystyle\sum_i\omega_i^2r_i^2$ where $r_i$ represents the cartesian cooridnates. Plugging this into \hl{previous eq} then the \textit{in-situ} density profile is given by
\begin{equation}
n(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{\lambda_T^3}\Li{\ssfrac{3}{2}}{\xi \,\exp{\sum_i\frac{-m\omega_i^2r_i^2}{2 k_B T}}}
\end{equation}

Argue what z is \hl{what is it's range?}, then say that it is small when T is large. Therefore, writing the first few terms of the series expansion of Eq.\ref{eq:polylog_def}
	\begin{equation}
	\text{Li}_{\gamma}[z] = z + \frac{z^2}{2^{\gamma}} + \frac{z^3}{3^{\gamma}} + \cdots
	\end{equation}
we see that Li$_{\gamma}[z] \approx z$ for $z \ll 1$. This corresponds to the high temperature limit which should result in recovery of the MB solution and indeed it does.
In the classical, or high-temperature, limit $\Li{\ssfrac{3}{2}}{z(\vec{r})} \approx z(\vec{r})$. From Eq. we see that this that in the limiting case we get the expected Maxwell-Boltzmann density profile \hl{what happens with $\xi$}. In the following we will continue to use the full expressions with an explicit dependence on the polylogarithm as it is the most general form, however, we will use this approximation to ensure our expressions match those expected from a classical Maxwell-Boltzmann description of the gas.

\hl{this can be simplified}
\begin{equation}
n(\vec{r}) = \frac{\xi}{\lambda_T^3}\exp{\sum_i\frac{-m\omega_i^2r_i^2}{2 k_B T}}
\end{equation}

\hl{I'd like to put in something about the momentum distribution}

\subsection{Extracting data from column densities} \label{ssec:tof}

This description of the atoms in the trapping potential is useful but we need to go a step further because we use absorption imaging to determine properties of the atom after a time of flight.

Maybe put in something about different measurement techniques and refernce the ketterle and pethick and smith again.

Removeing the trap results in ballistic expansion with the above spatial density profile as the initial conditions. 
To derive how we find the properties of the atoms, consider the above spatial density profile as the initial conditions.

Atoms expand ballistically according to
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}=\frac{\vec{p}}{m} \text{and} \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}=0
\end{equation}
Thus, an atom measured at position $\vec{r}$ after the time-of-flight, $t$, will have moved a distance $\brcurs = \frac{\vec{p}t}{m}=\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0$ from its initial position $\vec{r}_0$

\begin{figure} 
	\centerline{
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ballistic_expansion.png}}
	\caption{Ballistic expansion of particles}{Schematic representation particle displacement vectors used to determine how time-of-flight expansion transforms the initial density distibution}
\end{figure}

\hl{make the tof density n'}
the spatial density evolves then \hl{double check $2\pi \hbar$ denom}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
n(\vec{r},t) &= \int \frac{d^3\vec{r}\,d^3\vec{p}}{(2\pi\hbar)^3}\frac{1}{\exp{\left[\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(\vec{r}') - \mu\right]\frac{1}{k_BT}}-1}\delta^3\left(\vec{r}-\frac{\vec{p}t}{m}-\vec{r}'\right) \\
&= \int \frac{d^3\vec{p}}{(2\pi\hbar)^3}\frac{1}{\exp{\left[\frac{p^2}{2m} + V\left(\vec{r}-\frac{\vec{p}t}{m}\right)) - \mu\right]\frac{1}{k_BT}}-1} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Plugging in the harmonic potential we find that free expansion after release from a harmonic trap is self-similar and amounts to rescaling the the spatial coordinates by \hl{check Demarco's thesis}. Thus the scaled spatial profile is given by
\begin{equation}
n_{th}'(\vec{r},t) = \frac{1}{\lambda_T^3} 
\left(\, \prod_{j=1}^3 \frac{1}{1+\omega_j^2 t^2} \right) 
\Li{\ssfrac{3}{2}}{ \xi \, \exp{\sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{-m\omega_i^2r_i^2}{2k_BT} \frac{1}{1+\omega_i^2t^2}} }
\end{equation}

Using this description of the spatial distribution after time-of-flight expansion, we must now consider how to relate our absorption measurement to the physically relevant variables of the gas.

Finally we must consider the column density along one direction since we are taking absorption images of the atoms. A brief description of absorption imaging and system used for this process is given in \hl{some sec}. 

Simply stated, absorption imaging is the process of illuminating a gas of atoms with resonant (or near resonant) laser light and taking a spatially resolved image of the laser beam. As the light is tuned near a resonant transition, the atoms will absorb and scatter photons out of the original laser beam resulting in a "shadow" which is proportional to the number of scatters within a certain spatial region. This shadow image is then normalized by taking another picture of the laser after the atoms have fallen out of the imaging region. This relation of the light attenuation to the number density of scattering particles is known as Beer's law and results 

Using Beer's law \hl{cite}, we can relate the total absorption of photons to the number density of scattering particles along the optical path multiplied by the absorption cross section. This results in a measurement of the "optical depth" of the gas along a column density. Measurement along a particular direction limits our description of the gas to the two-dimensional plane orthogonal to the laser beam as shown in \hl{some fig from ch 2}.

Experimentally, the optical depth is trivially computed by taking the natural logarithm of the ratio of the images obtained from the camera. We then equate this OD image to be proportional to the spatial density profile after the time-of-flight expansion integrated along the optical path through the atoms.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{OD} = \text{ln} \left( \frac{\text{Atom Image}}{\text{Background Image}} \right) &= \sigma_{abs} \int_{-\inf}^{\inf} dz \, n_{th}'(\vec{r},t) \\ 
&= \frac{\sigma_{abs}}{\lambda_T^3} \left( \prod_{j=1}^3 \frac{1}{1+\omega_i^2t^2}\right) \int_{-\inf}^{\inf} dz\,\Li{\ssfrac{3}{2}}{\xi \,\exp{\sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{-r_i^2}{2\sigma_i^2}}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_i^2 = \frac{k_BT}{m\omega_i^2}(1+\omega_i^2t^2$. Need to say something about the integral in Eq.\hl{prev} and evaluating the integral along z so going to write out the explicit spatial dependence in cartesian coordinates. Additionally, we'll rewrite the polylogarithm in terms of it's series representation in order to see an identity
\begin{equation}
\int_{-\inf}^{\inf} dz\,\Li{\ssfrac{3}{2}}{\xi \,\exp{\sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{-r_i^2}{2\sigma_i^2}}} = 
\int_{-\inf}^{\inf} dz\, \sum_{n=1}^{\inf} \frac{\xi^n}{n^{3/2}}\exp{\frac{-x^2}{2\sigma_x^2} - \frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y^2} - \frac{z^2}{2\sigma_z^2}}^n
\end{equation}
Defining $\rho=\exp{\frac{-x^2}{2\sigma_x^2} - \frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y^2}}$ and expanding the series out, Eq.\hl{above} becomes
\begin{equation}
=\int_{-\inf}^{\inf} dz\, \xi\rho\exp{\frac{-z^2}{2\sigma_z^2}} + 
 \frac{\xi^2}{2^{3/2}}\rho^2\exp{\frac{-z^2}{2\sigma_z^2}}^2 + 
 \frac{\xi^3}{3^{3/2}}\rho^3\exp{\frac{-z^2}{2\sigma_z^2}}^3 + \cdots
\end{equation}
In this form we can readily separate out the dependence on $z$ and perform the integral making use of the following identity \hl{check identity} $\displaystyle\int_{-\inf}^{\inf} dz\, \sum_{n=1}^{\inf}\exp{\frac{-z^2}{2\sigma_2^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{n^{1/2}}\sigma_z$. Eq.\hl{above} then reduces to
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&=\int_{-\inf}^{\inf} dz\, \sum_{n=1}^{\inf}\frac{\xi^2\rho^n}{n^{3/2}}\exp{\frac{-z^2}{2\sigma_2^2}} \\
&=\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_z\underbrace{\sum_{n=1}^{\inf}\frac{\xi^n\rho^n}{n^2}}_{\displaystyle\Li{2}{\xi\rho}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

We are now ready to plug this result for the integral back into the full expression for the optical depth. Retaining the explicit expression in cartesian coordinates, Eq.\hl{above} becomes
\begin{equation}
OD(x,y) = \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\lambda_T^3}\frac{\sigma_{abs} \sigma_z}{(1+\omega_x^2t^2)(1+\omega_y^2t^2)(1+\omega_z^2t^2)} \Li{2}{\xi\,\exp{\frac{-x^2}{2\sigma_x^2} - \frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y^2}}}
\end{equation}
This equation still has one unknown, $\sigma_z$, that we cannot readily measure. This problem is solved by recognizing that we can readily calculate and measure a specific value of Eq.\hl{something}, namely the peak optical depth (OD$_\text{peak}$) located at $x=0,y=0$.
\begin{equation}
OD_{\text{peak}} = \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{\lambda_T^3}\frac{\sigma_{abs} \sigma_z}{(1+\omega_x^2t^2)(1+\omega_y^2t^2)(1+\omega_z^2t^2)} \Li{2}{\xi}
\end{equation}
thus the relation between the measured optical depth and the spatial density distribution is given by
\begin{equation}
OD(x,y) = \frac{\text{OD}_{\text{peak}}}{\Li{2}{\xi}}\Li{2}{\xi\,\exp{\frac{-x^2}{2\sigma_x^2} - \frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y^2}}}
\end{equation}
and in the limit of long expansion time during time-of-flight, namely $t \gg \omega_x^{-1}, \omega_y^{-1}, \omega_z^{-1}$ then the measured widths reduce to $\sigma_i^2=\frac{k_BT}{m}t^2$ and the atom temperature is given along each axis by
\begin{equation}
T_i=\frac{m \sigma_i^2}{k_Bt^2}
\end{equation}
Regarding the assumption that the expansion time is much greater then the trap frequencies, we should note that limiting factors in the expansion time are due to center of mass motion of the cloud under the influence of gravity. In the Neutral apparatus we typically utilize drop times are $\approx$ 30 ms. For shallow traps, where $\omega_i$ is be small, then the atoms may not have enough time during expansion to achieve fully ballistic expansion. In these cases it is typical to quote temperatures of the sample as measured along the tightest axis of confinement.

Last thing to do is to relate our expression for optical depth and number density to the total number of atoms in the trap. This task is straightforward by recalling the boson normalization requriement
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
N&=\int_{-\inf}^{\inf} d^3\vec{r} n_th(\vec{r}) = \int_{-\inf}^{\inf} d^3\vec{r} n_th'(\vec{r},t) \\
&=\int_{-\inf}^{\inf} d^3\vec{r} \frac{\sigma_{abs}}{\lambda_T^3}\frac{1}{(1+\omega_x^2t^2)(1+\omega_y^2t^2)(1+\omega_z^2t^2)} \sum_{n=1}^{\inf} \frac{\xi^n}{n^{3/2}} \exp{\frac{-x^2}{2\sigma_x^2} - \frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y^2} - \frac{z^2}{2\sigma_z^2}}^n
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This equation is the same probem we saw above but integrated over all axes instead of just one. Therefore we can apply the same expansion and identity we employed to solve for the optical depth to find
\begin{equation}
N=\frac{(2\pi)^{3/2}}{\lambda_T^3} \frac{\sigma_x \sigma_y \sigma_z}{(1+\omega_x^2t^2)(1+\omega_y^2t^2)(1+\omega_z^2t^2))}\Li{3}{\xi}
\end{equation}
From our expression for the optical depth, Eq.\hl{some}, we can simply this to
\begin{equation}
N=\frac{2\pi\sigma_x\sigma_y}{\sigma_{abs}}\text{OD}_{\text{peak}}\frac{\Li{3}{\xi}}{\Li{2}{\xi}}
\end{equation}

Eq.\hl{above} 


All of our information comes from taking pictures of our atomic clouds and inferring the physical properties of the gas before the time-of-flight expansion. This is possible since we know the density profile of the gas in-situ. In the absence of external fields, other than gravity, turning off the trapping potential results in ballistic expansion described by $\vec{r} = \vec{r}_0 + \frac{p^2}{2m}t$, where $\vec{r}_0$ and $p$ are the position and momentum at the moment of release from the trap and $t$ is the expansion time. Neglecting the center-of-mass motion due to gravity and assuming long expansion times, then we can easily find a regime where $\frac{p^2}{2m}t \gg \vec{r}_0$ and therefore
	\begin{equation}
		\vec{r} \approx \frac{p^2}{2m}t
	\end{equation}

Time of flight is essentially a Fourier transform which turns the initial momentum information into spatial information.



\section{Characterizing cold collisions} \label{sec:cold_collisions}



\subsection{Low energy scattering} \label{ssec:scattering}

this results in a poitential that supports bound states. 
In atomic physics, our low density gases are mainly within the regime of small interactions. 
This spatial dependence is mapped onto the internal energy levels of each atom. I want to say dressed state model here (review atom-photon coupling, atomic physics book).

consider the two particle system as a single entagled particle
	long range part of this quasi-particle is just the eigenstates of the separate particles themselves (only composed of two parts)
	but the short range part is going to be determined by some complex physics (new eigenstates, what is the coupling mechanism?)
		the vdW point is the boundary distance?
		coupling is due to the interatomic potential, there is at least the long-range part falling off as R6, what are the types of interactions which make up the internal wall?


Think I want to introduce the photoassocation by talking about the collisional wavefunction

what will that do?

I want to build up ideas about the FCF and need the wf for that
	to get qf I have to go back to scattering theory

ideas of the wavefunction become that basis for how you want to talk about interacting potentials


free atoms
scatering as single particle state (differnet eigenstate)
	interaction determined by some gnarly stuff
From scattering theory we know that the long range behavior is determined by short range physics
	how do we know this? (the dalibard intro)
Can we come up with good enough pseudo potentials to describe the short range physics and then solve the schrodinger equation to extract wavefunctions?
	we want wavefunctions because that is the full characterization
	we don't know the right eigenbasis for the short range part but we can make some guesses (in particular Hund cases setup eigen states for various possible internal states)
	Bohn and Julienne theory guessed based on using quantum defect theory
		this pre-supposes that the bound and free wavefunctions are similar (I forget in what respect) but that the bound ones must go to zero as R->Inf
If we have some notion of the wf then we can construct matricies which define interactions once we add additional coupling to the scattering problem


now in a position where I need to connect scattering theory and the PAS


Once we have the ground state wavefunction of our new particle we can construct the internal structure by considering the internal energy strucutrue of the constituent atoms
	Can I make a connnection that since it is a composite particle we must consider all the various configurations available?

\subsection{Modifying interactions with external fields} \label{ssec:mod_int}

Also the Chin '10 review on feshbach resonances

Follow the Nicholson 15 paper method of introing the elastic and inelastic cross sections

The use of a laser field as the coupling scheme in a Feshbach resonance introduces several advantages and complexities that must be considered when determining the expected properties of optical Feshbach molecules. In order to understand these differences, we will briefly outline the key concepts behind Feshbach resonances and the distinctions between optical and magnetic Feshbach resonances.


\begin{figure} \label{fig:ch3_FeshbachCartoon}
	\centerline{
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Fig4_feshbachCartoon.pdf}}
	\caption{Schematic representation of a Feshbach resonance}{(a) Potentials for the open ($^1S_0\!+\!^1S_0$) and closed ($^3P_1\!+\!^1S_0$) channel of an optically coupled Feshbach resonance in strontium. (b) The same coupling shown in (a) in the dressed state model. Tuning of the excited potential is achieved by varying the laser frequency detuning, $\delta = \omega_p - \omega_{bound}$, and $\omega_{free}$ is the $^1S_0\!\rightarrow\!^3P_1$ atomic transition frequency.}
\end{figure} 
	

The basic idea of a Feshbach resonance is outlined in Fig.\;\ref{fig:FeshbachCartoon}. Consider a simple two channel system, denoted by the open channel and the closed channel. The open channel is generally a ground state potential for two free atoms near threshold. Atoms occupying this state can undergo elastic collisions and, in the absence of any external perturbation, will remain in the open channel. Conversely, the closed channel is a bound state of a higher lying potential who's energy can be tuned relative to the open channel. In the absence of coupling between the states, the open and closed channel remain eigenstates of the system as the tuning parameter, and therefore the energy of the closed channel, is changed. However, in the presence of coupling between the channels, the original eigenstates are mixed and develop an avoided crossing between the bare open and closed channels, when tuned across the resonance. The power of Feshbach resonances comes from the ability to externally manipulate the degree of state mixing, which results in control of the s-wave scattering length and the creation of low energy Feshbach molecules.

Magnetic Feshbach resonances (MFR) are used extensively in alkali metal systems to tune the scattering properties of ultracold gases since the ground states of these systems feature a magnetic moment due to an unpaired electron in the valence shell. Thus, MFRs utilize interactions between low lying ground state molecular potentials via spin-dependent couplings. Since both the open and closed channel are ground state potentials, MFRs often exhibit extraordinarily long lifetimes \cite{Chin2010,Kohler2006}. Conversely, in strontium the ground state is a $^1S_0$ state, as shown in Fig.\;\ref{fig:energy_level_diagram}. This state is not magnetically sensitive, so no MFRs exist near the $^1S_0\!+\!^1S_0$ interatomic potential. Fortunately, optical Feshbach resonances (OFR) serve as another method to introduce coupling between the ground state potential (open channel) and a molecular state of an electronically excited potential (closed channel). Our work has utilized coupling between the $^1S_0\!+\!^1S_0$ and  $^3P_1\!+\!^1S_0$ two-body potentials via the narrow $^1S_0\!\rightarrow\!^3P_1$ atomic transition at 689nm. Fig.\;\ref{fig:FeshbachCartoon} shows a schematic of the potentials involved in the OFR of strontium in both the bare atomic and dressed state pictures. In the dressed basis we consider the combined atom + photon field system such that the channels become $\ket{^1S_0\!+\!^1S_0\!+\!n_p\hbar\omega_p}$ as the open channel and $\ket{^3P_1\!+\!^1S_0\!+\!(n_p-1)\hbar\omega_p}$ for the closed channel. As the light field frequency, $\omega_p$, is varied the excited closed channel potential will experience an energy shift relative to the open channel, resulting in resonant coupling between the open and closed channels. \cite{Ciuryo2005,Bohn1997,Fedichev1996a}

Both MFRs and OFRs can be treated by the same theoretical formalism, as a modification of the collisional properties between two particles \cite{Nicholson2015a,Chin2010}. One of the hallmarks of ultracold physics is the simplicity of atomic collisions. As bosonic atoms get colder they can only collide via $\ell=0$ partial waves and thus the elastic collision rate between two atoms becomes energy independent and can be parameterized by a single fixed quantity, $a_s$. This parameter is known as the s-wave scattering length and is determined by the short range molecular potential between two colliding atoms. Through a similar approach, collisions near Feshbach resonances can be modeled by introducing a complex s-wave scattering length, $\tilde{\alpha}$. In this model, the magnitude of $\tilde{\alpha}$ influences the elastic scattering rate between particles while the imaginary part describes losses through inelastic scattering. Under an isolated Feshbach resonance model at low energies, this complex scattering length is given by \cite{Chin2010}
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:complexScatter_constant}
		\tilde{\alpha} = a - ib = \frac{a_s \Gamma_0}{-E_0 + \imath (\gamma/2)}
	\end{equation}
where $E_0$ and $\Gamma_0$ are the energy independent parameters for, respectively, the resonance position and coupling strength between channels, and $\gamma$ is a general decay term associated with loss from the closed channel. Using Eq.\;\ref{eq:complexScatter_constant}, we can note the two main differences between MFRs and OFRs. Most experimentally useful MFRs, such as in Li and K, have negligible closed channel decay, $\gamma = 0$, and a fixed coupling strength between the open and closed channels. Thus, the change in the s-wave scattering length takes on a particularly simple form, 
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:MFRscatter}
		\tilde{\alpha} = a_s \left( 1- \frac{\Delta}{B - B_0} \right)
	\end{equation}
where $B_0$ is the resonance position and the coupling strength is parameterized by a magnetic width $\Delta$, such that $\Gamma_0 = \delta \mu \Delta$ with $\delta \mu$ the difference in magnetic moments between the open and closed channel. 

Conversely, OFRs offer the possibility to tune the coupling strength between the open and closed channel, since the coupling depends on the transition matrix element which varies with the square root of laser intensity. Furthermore, since OFRs utilize electronically excited states which have a natural lifetime, $\gamma$ is nonzero. This results in inelastic loss processes for OFRs. Similar to MFRs, we can define the change in scattering length as \cite{Nicholson2015a,Yan2013c,Blatt}
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:OFRscatter}
		\tilde{\alpha} = a_s \left( 1 - \frac{w \delta}{\delta^2 + \gamma^2/4} + \frac{i}{2} \frac{w \gamma}{\delta^2 + \gamma^2/4} \right)
	\end{equation}
where $\delta=\omega - \omega_0$ is the detuning from the chosen photoassociation resonance at $\omega_0$ as shown in Fig.\;\ref{fig:FeshbachCartoon}, and the width of the resonance is defined by $w = -\ell_{opt} \, \gamma / a_s$. Typically, the strength of OFRs are characterized by their optical length \cite{Nicholson2015a,Chin2010} given by $\ell_{opt} = a_s \Gamma_0 / \gamma = \frac{\lambda_{OFR}^3}{16 \pi c} \frac{ \left| \left< n | E \right> \right|^2}{k} I$. Here $c$ is the speed of light, $\lambda_{OFR}$ is the wavelength of the coupling laser, and $\left| \left< n | E \right> \right|^2$ is the free-bound Frank-Condon factor between the bound state $\bra{n}$ and scattering state $\ket{E}$. Additionally, it is useful to identify the real and imaginary parts of Eq.\;\ref{eq:OFRscatter} as defined in Eq.\;\ref{eq:complexScatter_constant}.
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:OFRparts}
		 a_{\scriptscriptstyle OFR} = a_s + \ell_{opt} \gamma \frac{\delta}{\delta^2+\gamma^2/4} \qquad
		 b_{\scriptscriptstyle OFR} = \frac{\ell_{opt}}{2} \frac{\gamma^2}{\delta^2+\gamma^2/4}
	\end{equation}

Our previous work exploring the use of an optical Feshbach resonance took advantage of photoassociation transitions with large optical lengths to control the scattering length of an $^{88}$Sr BEC as described by Eq.\;\ref{eq:OFRscatter}. However, all studies of OFR to date have been limited by large atom loss rates \cite{Thalhammer2005,Theis2004,Fatemi2000,Blatt,Yan2013c} which can be modeled as a density evolution, $\dot{n} = -K_{in}n^2$, where $K_{in}$ is the two-body inelastic loss rate constant. In the low energy limit, $k\!\rightarrow\!0$, the inelastic loss rate is given by
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:K_in}
		K_{in} = \frac{8 \pi \hbar}{\mu_{r}} b_{\scriptscriptstyle OFR} = \frac{4 \pi \hbar}{\mu_r} \frac{\ell_{opt} \gamma^2}{\delta^2 + \gamma^2 / 4}
	\end{equation}
where $\mu_r$ is the reduced mass, $\delta$ is the laser detuning as shown in Fig.\;\ref{fig:FeshbachCartoon}.


\section{Modeling of photoassociation lineshapes} \label{sec:bohn_and_julienne}

This section will concern the general theory used to describe photoassociative spectra. While a full quantum close-coupling calculation is the most complete and rigorous method for analyzing cold quantum scattering problems, useful approximations can be applied to realize relatively more "simple" closed analytic formulas describing photoassociation spectra. 

ideas of limiting cases that can be explored with PAS \cite{Ciuryo2004}

\subsection{One-photon excitation of free to bound transitions} \label{ssec:one_color_pa}

\subsubsection{PAS near narrow intercombination transitions} \label{sssec:narrow_pa}

\subsection{Extension to two-color spectra} \label{ssec:two_color_pa}




Now that we have the theory of PAS covered. 

This section will cover the theory of lineshapes in PAS.

Somewhere I read about three regimes of PAS as a comparison of relevant energy scales. Should explore that here

\begin{equation}\label{eq:number}
   N(t)={N_0 \rm{e}^{-\Gamma t} \over 1+
   {2 N_0 \langle K \rangle V_2\over \Gamma V_1^2}(1-\rm{e}^{-\Gamma t})}
\end{equation}
where  $N_0$  is the number  at the beginning of the PAS interaction
time, and $\langle K \rangle$ indicates a spatial average of collision event rate constant $K$ (Eq.\ \ref{equationKeffective}). The one-body loss rate, $\Gamma$, is due to background
collisions and off-resonant scattering from the PA lasers.

PA loss is described with a local equation for the evolution of the atomic density [Eq.~(\ref{densitydecay})]. Integrating Eq.~(\ref{densitydecay}) over the trap volume yields the time evolution of the number of trapped atoms [Eq.~(\ref{number})]. The effective volumes used throughout this analysis are defined by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:effectivevolumes}
	V_{\text{q}}=\int_{\mathrm{V}} d^3r \, e^{-\frac{qU(\mathbf{r})}{k_{B}T}},
\end{equation}
for trapping potential $U(\mathbf{r})$. The collision event rate constant can be expressed as a thermal average of the scattering probability for loss, $\vert S(\epsilon,\omega_1,\omega_2,...,\mathbf{r})\vert^2$, over the collision energy $\epsilon$. We also average over the trap volume to allow for the possibility that the scattering probability can vary with position in the trap due to inhomogeneity of laser intensity profiles and the density distribution [Eq.~(\ref{equationKeffective})].

%This yields
\begin{eqnarray} \label{equationKeffective}
% \nonumber to remove numbering (before each equation)
  \langle K \rangle&=& \frac{1}{V_{2}}\int_{\mathrm{V}}
d^3r \,
          e^{-\frac{2U(\vec{r})}{k_{B}T}} \nonumber \\
         &&\times \frac{1}{h\,Q_{T}}
\int_{0}^{U_{max}-U(r)}d\epsilon \vert S\vert^2
   \,e^{-\epsilon/k_{B}T}.
\end{eqnarray}
%\begin{equation}\label{Kintegral}
%   K=\frac{1}{h\,Q_{T}} \int \vert S(\epsilon,\omega_1,\omega_2,...)\vert^2
%   \,e^{-\epsilon/k_{B}T} \; d\epsilon,
%\end{equation}
where the partition function is $Q_{T}=\left({2\pi k_{B}T \mu \over
h^2}\right) ^{3/2}$ for reduced mass $\mu$.


Bohn and Julienne \cite{bju96} provide an expression for $\vert S(\epsilon,\omega_1,\omega_2,...)\vert^2$ for a collision on the open channel of two ground state atoms (g) with total energy $\epsilon$ leading to loss-producing decay from the excited state $b_1$ with rate $\gamma_1$. (See Fig.\ \ref{PASDiagram}.) It yields
\begin{eqnarray}\label{equationSprob}
  \vert S\vert^2 =   \hspace{2.5in}&&\\
  {(\Delta_2+\epsilon/\hbar)^2{\gamma}_1{\gamma}_s \over
  	\left[(\Delta_1+\epsilon/\hbar)(\Delta_2+\epsilon/\hbar)-\frac{\Omega_{12}^{2}}{4}\right]^2+\left[ \frac{\gamma_1+\gamma_s}{2}\right]^2(\Delta_2+		 	\epsilon/\hbar)^2}, &&\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where all quantities are defined in the main text. For simplicity, we have omitted the light shift of $b_1$ due to coupling to the scattering continuum \cite{bju99}. Equation (\ref{equationSprob}) neglects all light shifts due to the trapping laser. Light shifts due to the photoassociation lasers coupling to states outside our model (Fig.\ \ref{PASDiagram}) are also neglected. The thermal energy is much greater than the zero-point energy for trap motion, $T\gg h\nu_{\text{trap}}/k_B$, so confinement effects are negligible \cite{zbl06}.

%$\Delta_1=\omega_1-E_{b1}/\hbar$ and $\Delta_2=\omega_1-\omega_2-E_{b2}/\hbar$ are the one-photon detuning from state $b_1$ and two-photon detuning from state $b_2$ respectively for initial scattering state with $\epsilon=0$.

%, which is a good approximation for our experiment because the light shift of state 1 is small compared to the detuning $\hbar \Delta_1$,
and lights shifts of states 0 and 2 are approximately equal and will cancel in the determination of the binding energy of the halo state, $E_2$ \cite{rbm04,rfk87}. Neglecting

%We record spectra by varying $\Delta_2$ at fixed detuning from the intermediate state $\Delta_1$

For the experiments reported here, we maintain significant intermediate-state detuning, $|\Delta_1|\gg |\Omega_{12}|$. Thus we are in a Raman configuration, and near two-photon resonance the expression for the scattering probability for a given initial scattering energy Eq.~(\ref{equationSprob}) can be approximated as a Lorentzian
\begin{eqnarray}\label{equationSprobLorentzian}
 \vert S\vert^2 \approx {A(\epsilon) \over
 \left(\Delta_2+\epsilon/\hbar-\frac{\Omega_{12}^{2}}{4(\Delta_1+\epsilon/\hbar)}\right)^2+\left[ {\Gamma_L(\epsilon)}/{2}\right]^2},
\end{eqnarray}
where $A$ and $\Gamma_L$ are defined in Eqs.\ (\ref{ApproxLorentzianQuantitiesMain}) and (\ref{ApproxLorentzianQuantities-2Main}).

As discussed in the text, we analyze loss spectra using the effective expression, Eq.\ (\ref{equationApproxLorentzian}) to account for possible deviations from the single-channel theory \cite{bju96}.

%\section{AC Stark shift due to excitation lasers}
\label{App:ACStark}
The total 689-nm intensity oscillates with 100\% contrast according to
$I_{total}=I_1+I_2+2\sqrt{I_1I_2}\cos \left[(\omega_1-\omega_2)t \right]=2I\left\{1+\cos \left[(\omega_1-\omega_2)t \right]\right\}$.
Equation \ref{Eq:ACStarkFullModel}
The form of the AC Stark shift
due to excitation lasers in Eq.\ \ref{Eq:GlobalFit}
 reflects the time average of the intensity and neglects the interference term. To confirm that this is the correct description, we numerically solved the time-evolution for a three-level system with similar optical couplings and oscillating optical intensity as present during halo photoassociation. The Hamiltonian is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{Eq:ThreeLevelHamiltonian}
H= \hspace{3in} \\
 \nonumber\\
\left(
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      0 & \Omega_{01}\left[\mathrm{cos}(\omega_1 t)+ \mathrm{cos}(\omega_2 t)\right] & 0 \\
      . & E_{b1} & \Omega_{12}\left[\mathrm{cos}(\omega_1 t)+ \mathrm{cos}(\omega_2 t)\right] \\
      . & . & E_{b2} \\
    \end{array}
  \right)
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
For  $\Omega_{01}\ll \Omega_{12} \ll \Delta_{1}\equiv E_{b1}/\hbar-\omega_1$, which is analogous to the  experimental conditions used here

, the shift of the two-photon resonance condition follows $\delta={\Omega_{12}^{2}}/{2\Delta_{1}}$ in agreement with Eq. \ref{Eq:ACStarkFullModel}.
