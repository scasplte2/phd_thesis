\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:pas_intro}

This part needs to be brief and really should motivate the idea of PAS.

Okk, first ogg we introduce the potential between atoms

this arises from the interaction of scattering theory with a molecular state. ''the interaction potential between two atoms. Ehich is caused by?

this results in a poitential that supports bound states . In atomic physics, our low density fases are mainly within the regime of small interactions. This spatial dependence is mapped onto the internal energy levels of each atom. I want to say dressed state model here (review atom-photon coupling, atomic physics book).

Definitely need some BS about how simple scattering theory has been a hallmark of atomic physics and 

What about the history of scattering? Most of what we know about quantum mechanics comes from either scattering experiments of spectroscopy. Photoassociation spectroscopy is an important field which relies on both of these properties.

ideas of limiting cases that can be explored with PAS \cite{Ciuryo2004}

PA is not unique to atomic physics, chemists have been using light to interrogate molecular structure for a long time

physicists molecule, short-range PA, rabi oscilations between atomic and molecular condensates (cite ours and the lattice experiment that followed)

Pioneering work done in the early 90's used PA to interrogate the sturucture of interatomic potentials to deduce the scattering lengths between atoms. 

a photoassociation experiment can be used to map the square of the scattering wave function in the ground electronic state at the Condon points corresponding to the different excited bound levels. \cite{Borkowski2009}

Can even be used to modify the scattering length of atoms through mixing of atomic eigenstates.

This work is focused on long-range PA but in recent years groups have also developed short-range PA techniques for the creation of rovibrational ground state molecules. These techniques rely heavily on favorable overlap integrals betwwen molecular wavefunctions and typically searching for favorable intermediate states is a pain (that is why our large FCF might be useful)

There are multiple flavors of PAS. Can do one-photon or two-photon. 

PA can come in many forms (in a lattice, in a bulk gas, via dissociating molecules) Experimentally we observe PA by looking for trap loss \hl{doublon paper}.

Density profile expands self-similarly 

Time of flight is essentially a Fourier transform which turns the initial momentum information into spatial information.



\section{Characterizing cold collisions} \label{sec:cold_collisions}

\subsection{Low energy scattering} \label{ssec:scattering}

consider the two particle system as a single entagled particle
	long range part of this quasi-particle is just the eigenstates of the separate particles themselves (only composed of two parts)
	but the short range part is going to be determined by some complex physics (new eigenstates, what is the coupling mechanism?)
		the vdW point is the boundary distance?
		coupling is due to the interatomic potential, there is at least the long-range part falling off as R6, what are the types of interactions which make up the internal wall?


Think I want to introduce the photoassocation by talking about the collisional wavefunction

what will that do?

I want to build up ideas about the FCF and need the wf for that
	to get qf I have to go back to scattering theory

ideas of the wavefunction become that basis for how you want to talk about interacting potentials


free atoms
scatering as single particle state (differnet eigenstate)
	interaction determined by some gnarly stuff
From scattering theory we know that the long range behavior is determined by short range physics
	how do we know this? (the dalibard intro)
Can we come up with good enough pseudo potentials to describe the short range physics and then solve the schrodinger equation to extract wavefunctions?
	we want wavefunctions because that is the full characterization
	we don't know the right eigenbasis for the short range part but we can make some guesses (in particular Hund cases setup eigen states for various possible internal states)
	Bohn and Julienne theory guessed based on using quantum defect theory
		this pre-supposes that the bound and free wavefunctions are similar (I forget in what respect) but that the bound ones must go to zero as R->Inf
If we have some notion of the wf then we can construct matricies which define interactions once we add additional coupling to the scattering problem


now in a position where I need to connect scattering theory and the PAS


Once we have the ground state wavefunction of our new particle we can construct the internal structure by considering the internal energy strucutrue of the constituent atoms
	Can I make a connnection that since it is a composite particle we must consider all the various configurations available?

Follow the Nicholson 15 paper method of introing the elastic and inelastic cross sections

The use of a laser field as the coupling scheme in a Feshbach resonance introduces several advantages and complexities that must be considered when determining the expected properties of optical Feshbach molecules. In order to understand these differences, we will briefly outline the key concepts behind Feshbach resonances and the distinctions between optical and magnetic Feshbach resonances.

(b) The same coupling shown in (a) in the dressed state model.

\end{figure} 
	

The basic idea of a Feshbach resonance is outlined in Fig.\;\ref{fig:FeshbachCartoon}. Consider a simple two channel system, denoted by the open channel and the closed channel. The open channel is generally a ground state potential for two free atoms near threshold. Atoms occupying this state can undergo elastic collisions and, in the absence of any external perturbation, will remain in the open channel. Conversely, the closed channel is a bound state of a higher lying potential who's energy can be tuned relative to the open channel. In the absence of coupling between the states, the open and closed channel remain eigenstates of the system as the tuning parameter, and therefore the energy of the closed channel, is changed. However, in the presence of coupling between the channels, the original eigenstates are mixed and develop an avoided crossing between the bare open and closed channels, when tuned across the resonance. The power of Feshbach resonances comes from the ability to externally manipulate the degree of state mixing, which results in control of the s-wave scattering length and the creation of low energy Feshbach molecules.

Magnetic Feshbach resonances (MFR) are used extensively in alkali metal systems to tune the scattering properties of ultracold gases since the ground states of these systems feature a magnetic moment due to an unpaired electron in the valence shell. Thus, MFRs utilize interactions between low lying ground state molecular potentials via spin-dependent couplings. Since both the open and closed channel are ground state potentials, MFRs often exhibit extraordinarily long lifetimes \cite{Chin2010,Kohler2006}. Conversely, in strontium the ground state is a $^1S_0$ state, as shown in Fig.\;\ref{fig:energy_level_diagram}. This state is not magnetically sensitive, so no MFRs exist near the $^1S_0\!+\!^1S_0$ interatomic potential. Fortunately, optical Feshbach resonances (OFR) serve as another method to introduce coupling between the ground state potential (open channel) and a molecular state of an electronically excited potential (closed channel). Our work has utilized coupling between the $^1S_0\!+\!^1S_0$ and  $^3P_1\!+\!^1S_0$ two-body potentials via the narrow $^1S_0\!\rightarrow\!^3P_1$ atomic transition at 689nm. Fig.\;\ref{fig:FeshbachCartoon} shows a schematic of the potentials involved in the OFR of strontium in both the bare atomic and dressed state pictures. In the dressed basis we consider the combined atom + photon field system such that the channels become $\ket{^1S_0\!+\!^1S_0\!+\!n_p\hbar\omega_p}$ as the open channel and $\ket{^3P_1\!+\!^1S_0\!+\!(n_p-1)\hbar\omega_p}$ for the closed channel. As the light field frequency, $\omega_p$, is varied the excited closed channel potential will experience an energy shift relative to the open channel, resulting in resonant coupling between the open and closed channels. \cite{Ciuryo2005,Bohn1997,Fedichev1996a}

Both MFRs and OFRs can be treated by the same theoretical formalism, as a modification of the collisional properties between two particles \cite{Nicholson2015a,Chin2010}. One of the hallmarks of ultracold physics is the simplicity of atomic collisions. As bosonic atoms get colder they can only collide via $\ell=0$ partial waves and thus the elastic collision rate between two atoms becomes energy independent and can be parameterized by a single fixed quantity, $a_s$. This parameter is known as the s-wave scattering length and is determined by the short range molecular potential between two colliding atoms. Through a similar approach, collisions near Feshbach resonances can be modeled by introducing a complex s-wave scattering length, $\tilde{\alpha}$. In this model, the magnitude of $\tilde{\alpha}$ influences the elastic scattering rate between particles while the imaginary part describes losses through inelastic scattering. Under an isolated Feshbach resonance model at low energies, this complex scattering length is given by \cite{Chin2010}
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:complexScatter_constant}
		\tilde{\alpha} = a - ib = \frac{a_s \Gamma_0}{-E_0 + \imath (\gamma/2)}
	\end{equation}
where $E_0$ and $\Gamma_0$ are the energy independent parameters for, respectively, the resonance position and coupling strength between channels, and $\gamma$ is a general decay term associated with loss from the closed channel. Using Eq.\;\ref{eq:complexScatter_constant}, we can note the two main differences between MFRs and OFRs. Most experimentally useful MFRs, such as in Li and K, have negligible closed channel decay, $\gamma = 0$, and a fixed coupling strength between the open and closed channels. Thus, the change in the s-wave scattering length takes on a particularly simple form, 
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:MFRscatter}
		\tilde{\alpha} = a_s \left( 1- \frac{\Delta}{B - B_0} \right)
	\end{equation}
where $B_0$ is the resonance position and the coupling strength is parameterized by a magnetic width $\Delta$, such that $\Gamma_0 = \delta \mu \Delta$ with $\delta \mu$ the difference in magnetic moments between the open and closed channel. 

Conversely, OFRs offer the possibility to tune the coupling strength between the open and closed channel, since the coupling depends on the transition matrix element which varies with the square root of laser intensity. Furthermore, since OFRs utilize electronically excited states which have a natural lifetime, $\gamma$ is nonzero. This results in inelastic loss processes for OFRs. Similar to MFRs, we can define the change in scattering length as \cite{Nicholson2015a,Yan2013c,Blatt}
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:OFRscatter}
		\tilde{\alpha} = a_s \left( 1 - \frac{w \delta}{\delta^2 + \gamma^2/4} + \frac{i}{2} \frac{w \gamma}{\delta^2 + \gamma^2/4} \right)
	\end{equation}
where $\delta=\omega - \omega_0$ is the detuning from the chosen photoassociation resonance at $\omega_0$ as shown in Fig.\;\ref{fig:FeshbachCartoon}, and the width of the resonance is defined by $w = -\ell_{opt} \, \gamma / a_s$. Typically, the strength of OFRs are characterized by their optical length \cite{Nicholson2015a,Chin2010} given by $\ell_{opt} = a_s \Gamma_0 / \gamma = \frac{\lambda_{OFR}^3}{16 \pi c} \frac{ \left| \left< n | E \right> \right|^2}{k} I$. Here $c$ is the speed of light, $\lambda_{OFR}$ is the wavelength of the coupling laser, and $\left| \left< n | E \right> \right|^2$ is the free-bound Frank-Condon factor between the bound state $\bra{n}$ and scattering state $\ket{E}$. Additionally, it is useful to identify the real and imaginary parts of Eq.\;\ref{eq:OFRscatter} as defined in Eq.\;\ref{eq:complexScatter_constant}.
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:OFRparts}
		 a_{\scriptscriptstyle OFR} = a_s + \ell_{opt} \gamma \frac{\delta}{\delta^2+\gamma^2/4} \qquad
		 b_{\scriptscriptstyle OFR} = \frac{\ell_{opt}}{2} \frac{\gamma^2}{\delta^2+\gamma^2/4}
	\end{equation}

Our previous work exploring the use of an optical Feshbach resonance took advantage of photoassociation transitions with large optical lengths to control the scattering length of an $^{88}$Sr BEC as described by Eq.\;\ref{eq:OFRscatter}. However, all studies of OFR to date have been limited by large atom loss rates \cite{Thalhammer2005,Theis2004,Fatemi2000,Blatt,Yan2013c} which can be modeled as a density evolution, $\dot{n} = -K_{in}n^2$, where $K_{in}$ is the two-body inelastic loss rate constant. In the low energy limit, $k\!\rightarrow\!0$, the inelastic loss rate is given by
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:K_in}
		K_{in} = \frac{8 \pi \hbar}{\mu_{r}} b_{\scriptscriptstyle OFR} = \frac{4 \pi \hbar}{\mu_r} \frac{\ell_{opt} \gamma^2}{\delta^2 + \gamma^2 / 4}
	\end{equation}
where $\mu_r$ is the reduced mass, $\delta$ is the laser detuning as shown in Fig.\;\ref{fig:FeshbachCartoon}.


\section{Semi-classical treatment of lineshapes} \label{sec:bohn_and_julienne}

Now that we have the theory of PAS covered. 

This section will cover the theory of lineshapes in PAS.

Somewhere I read about three regimes of PAS as a comparison of relevant energy scales. Should explore that here

\begin{equation}\label{eq:number}
   N(t)={N_0 \rm{e}^{-\Gamma t} \over 1+
   {2 N_0 \langle K \rangle V_2\over \Gamma V_1^2}(1-\rm{e}^{-\Gamma t})}
\end{equation}
where  $N_0$  is the number  at the beginning of the PAS interaction
time, and $\langle K \rangle$ indicates a spatial average of collision event rate constant $K$ (Eq.\ \ref{equationKeffective}). The one-body loss rate, $\Gamma$, is due to background
collisions and off-resonant scattering from the PA lasers.

PA loss is described with a local equation for the evolution of the atomic density [Eq.~(\ref{densitydecay})]. Integrating Eq.~(\ref{densitydecay}) over the trap volume yields the time evolution of the number of trapped atoms [Eq.~(\ref{number})]. The effective volumes used throughout this analysis are defined by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:effectivevolumes}
	V_{\text{q}}=\int_{\mathrm{V}} d^3r \, e^{-\frac{qU(\mathbf{r})}{k_{B}T}},
\end{equation}
for trapping potential $U(\mathbf{r})$. The collision event rate constant can be expressed as a thermal average of the scattering probability for loss, $\vert S(\epsilon,\omega_1,\omega_2,...,\mathbf{r})\vert^2$, over the collision energy $\epsilon$. We also average over the trap volume to allow for the possibility that the scattering probability can vary with position in the trap due to inhomogeneity of laser intensity profiles and the density distribution [Eq.~(\ref{equationKeffective})].

%This yields
\begin{eqnarray} \label{equationKeffective}
% \nonumber to remove numbering (before each equation)
  \langle K \rangle&=& \frac{1}{V_{2}}\int_{\mathrm{V}}
d^3r \,
          e^{-\frac{2U(\vec{r})}{k_{B}T}} \nonumber \\
         &&\times \frac{1}{h\,Q_{T}}
\int_{0}^{U_{max}-U(r)}d\epsilon \vert S\vert^2
   \,e^{-\epsilon/k_{B}T}.
\end{eqnarray}
%\begin{equation}\label{Kintegral}
%   K=\frac{1}{h\,Q_{T}} \int \vert S(\epsilon,\omega_1,\omega_2,...)\vert^2
%   \,e^{-\epsilon/k_{B}T} \; d\epsilon,
%\end{equation}
where the partition function is $Q_{T}=\left({2\pi k_{B}T \mu \over
h^2}\right) ^{3/2}$ for reduced mass $\mu$.


Bohn and Julienne \cite{bju96} provide an expression for $\vert S(\epsilon,\omega_1,\omega_2,...)\vert^2$ for a collision on the open channel of two ground state atoms (g) with total energy $\epsilon$ leading to loss-producing decay from the excited state $b_1$ with rate $\gamma_1$. (See Fig.\ \ref{PASDiagram}.) It yields
\begin{eqnarray}\label{equationSprob}
  \vert S\vert^2 =   \hspace{2.5in}&&\\
  {(\Delta_2+\epsilon/\hbar)^2{\gamma}_1{\gamma}_s \over
  	\left[(\Delta_1+\epsilon/\hbar)(\Delta_2+\epsilon/\hbar)-\frac{\Omega_{12}^{2}}{4}\right]^2+\left[ \frac{\gamma_1+\gamma_s}{2}\right]^2(\Delta_2+		 	\epsilon/\hbar)^2}, &&\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where all quantities are defined in the main text. For simplicity, we have omitted the light shift of $b_1$ due to coupling to the scattering continuum \cite{bju99}. Equation (\ref{equationSprob}) neglects all light shifts due to the trapping laser. Light shifts due to the photoassociation lasers coupling to states outside our model (Fig.\ \ref{PASDiagram}) are also neglected. The thermal energy is much greater than the zero-point energy for trap motion, $T\gg h\nu_{\text{trap}}/k_B$, so confinement effects are negligible \cite{zbl06}.

%$\Delta_1=\omega_1-E_{b1}/\hbar$ and $\Delta_2=\omega_1-\omega_2-E_{b2}/\hbar$ are the one-photon detuning from state $b_1$ and two-photon detuning from state $b_2$ respectively for initial scattering state with $\epsilon=0$.

%, which is a good approximation for our experiment because the light shift of state 1 is small compared to the detuning $\hbar \Delta_1$,
and lights shifts of states 0 and 2 are approximately equal and will cancel in the determination of the binding energy of the halo state, $E_2$ \cite{rbm04,rfk87}. Neglecting

%We record spectra by varying $\Delta_2$ at fixed detuning from the intermediate state $\Delta_1$

For the experiments reported here, we maintain significant intermediate-state detuning, $|\Delta_1|\gg |\Omega_{12}|$. Thus we are in a Raman configuration, and near two-photon resonance the expression for the scattering probability for a given initial scattering energy Eq.~(\ref{equationSprob}) can be approximated as a Lorentzian
\begin{eqnarray}\label{equationSprobLorentzian}
 \vert S\vert^2 \approx {A(\epsilon) \over
 \left(\Delta_2+\epsilon/\hbar-\frac{\Omega_{12}^{2}}{4(\Delta_1+\epsilon/\hbar)}\right)^2+\left[ {\Gamma_L(\epsilon)}/{2}\right]^2},
\end{eqnarray}
where $A$ and $\Gamma_L$ are defined in Eqs.\ (\ref{ApproxLorentzianQuantitiesMain}) and (\ref{ApproxLorentzianQuantities-2Main}).

As discussed in the text, we analyze loss spectra using the effective expression, Eq.\ (\ref{equationApproxLorentzian}) to account for possible deviations from the single-channel theory \cite{bju96}.

%\section{AC Stark shift due to excitation lasers}
\label{App:ACStark}
The total 689-nm intensity oscillates with 100\% contrast according to
$I_{total}=I_1+I_2+2\sqrt{I_1I_2}\cos \left[(\omega_1-\omega_2)t \right]=2I\left\{1+\cos \left[(\omega_1-\omega_2)t \right]\right\}$.
Equation \ref{Eq:ACStarkFullModel}
The form of the AC Stark shift
due to excitation lasers in Eq.\ \ref{Eq:GlobalFit}
 reflects the time average of the intensity and neglects the interference term. To confirm that this is the correct description, we numerically solved the time-evolution for a three-level system with similar optical couplings and oscillating optical intensity as present during halo photoassociation. The Hamiltonian is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{Eq:ThreeLevelHamiltonian}
H= \hspace{3in} \\
 \nonumber\\
\left(
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      0 & \Omega_{01}\left[\mathrm{cos}(\omega_1 t)+ \mathrm{cos}(\omega_2 t)\right] & 0 \\
      . & E_{b1} & \Omega_{12}\left[\mathrm{cos}(\omega_1 t)+ \mathrm{cos}(\omega_2 t)\right] \\
      . & . & E_{b2} \\
    \end{array}
  \right)
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
For  $\Omega_{01}\ll \Omega_{12} \ll \Delta_{1}\equiv E_{b1}/\hbar-\omega_1$, which is analogous to the  experimental conditions used here

, the shift of the two-photon resonance condition follows $\delta={\Omega_{12}^{2}}/{2\Delta_{1}}$ in agreement with Eq. \ref{Eq:ACStarkFullModel}.
