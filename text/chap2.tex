\chapter{The Neutral apparatus}
\label{ch:chap2}

The Neutral apparatus has been one of the pioneering experiments for the trapping, cooling, and creation of quantum degenerate gases of neutral strontium \hl{BEC refs}. 
As such, there is a plethora of previous theses and publications which extensively outline the details for how to achieve these goals. \hl{refs}. 
In particular, we refer the reader to the PhD theses of previous Killian lab students: Francisco Camargo, Brian DeSalvo, Mi Yan, Pascal Mickelson, Natali Martinez de Escobar, and Sarah Nagel. 
Additionally, the PhD work of Simon Stellmer \cite{SimonStellmer2013} and review of strontium quantum degenerate gases are also highly recommended reading \cite{StellmerRev2013}.

Building upon this previous work, this chapter will forego an extensive review of the basic laser cooling techniques for strontium. 
We refer the reading to the extensive works listed above for a formal discussion of the theory behind laser cooling and trapping.
Instead, we will focus on the systems and processes which are crucial to the operation of the experiment with an emphasis on technical findings and changes which remain, as of yet, mostly undocumented.

Furthermore, it has been nearly a decade since the last broad apparatus overview \cite{MartinezdeEscolar2010} and the experiment has grown significantly in complexity in the intervening years.
Therefore, the goal of this chapter is to serve as a reference for future work and students. 
In this spirit, this chapter will be highly technical and provide an in-depth review of the operation and current status of the Neutral apparatus.
Where appropriate we will refer the reader to the relevant original thesis or published work.

This chapter will begin with a brief overview of our trapping procedure in order to contextualize the remaining sections focusing on the hardware including the vacuum system, various laser systems, and RF and electronics.
Furthermore, we will conclude with an outline of recent software implementations used to interface the digital world to the physical.
Detailed guides for this software can also be found in App. \ref{app:neuKLEIN}.

\section{Experimental procedure} \label{sec:trapping}

% Intro
Our experiments begin by cooling and trapping atomic strontium utilizing well-established atomic physics techniques \cite{Metcalf1999,Katori1999,Ido2000,Nagel2003,Mukaiyama2003a,Loftus2004,mmy09a,sth09a,Mickelson2010ja,Tey2010a,dym10a,stg10}. 
Fig. \;\ref{fig:energyLevels} shows the simplified energy level diagram employed in our cooling process. 
Once cooled, we typically obtain bulk samples in an optical dipole trap containing on the order of $10^6$ atoms at temperatures $<1\mu$K and densities between $10^{12} - 10^{15}\,$cm$^{-3}$ depending upon the isotope. 

The procedure outlined below is generally followed for trapping all isotopes of strontium with the major difference being timescales and laser frequencies.
Trapping of the bosonic isotopes of strontium is nearly identical across isotopes while fermionic $^{87}$Sr presents a greater challenge due to its high nuclear spin, $I=9/2$.
In short, due to the change in spin between the singlet and triplet series, there is a mismatch in the Zeeman shifts of the $^1S_0$ and $^3P_1$ states which leads to a change in sign of the Zeeman shift across the magnetic sublevels of the $^3P_1\,F=11/2$ hyperfine state of 87.
This sign change results in anti-trapped states causing atoms to be expelled from the MOT laser acting on the $^1S_0\,F=9/2\;\rightarrow\;^3P_1\,F=11/2$ transition.
The solution is then to add an additional laser addressing the $^1S_0\,F=9/2\;\rightarrow\;^3P_1\,F=9/2$ transition to randomize the $m_F$ populations in the $^1S_0$ ground state.
For a more thorough and detailed discussion of the relevant physics of trapping $^{87}$Sr in the red MOT, we refer the interested reader to the fermion portion of section 2.7.3 in the PhD thesis of Simon Stellmer \cite{SimonStellmer2013} and section 2.2.1 of Pascal Mikelson's PhD thesis \cite{Mickelson2010b}.

\noindent \rule{75pt}{0.5pt} \newline
The trapping process begins with vaporizing metallic strontium loaded in an oven heated to approximately 400 $^{\circ}$C. 
This strontium vapor escapes through thin collimating tubes to produce a partially collimated beam with a mean velocity of $\sim450$ m/s.
To aid in collimation, the atoms undergo a stage of transverse two dimensional optical molasses which is elongated and retro-reflected.
This helps increase the atom flux into the Zeeman slowing stage and we typically observe an approx. 7x improvement in trapped atom number with the 2D collimator versus without.
The majority of cooling is done using 461 nm light acting on the strongest dipole allowed transition between the $^1S_0\,\rightarrow\,^1P_1$ states.
The excited state lifetime of 5 ns ($\Gamma=30.5$MHz) and large energy separation between the states results in a hefty saturation intensity of 40.5 mW/cm$^2$ for this transition.
Therefore laser power on order of 100 mW are necessary to produce large optical forces and rapid cooling rates.

Once atoms have entered the magnetic field of the Zeeman slower, the highest velocity atoms begin to scatter photons from the Zeeman beam red detuned by approx. 16x the natural linewidth.
Large detunings help to eliminate unwanted photon scattering from the Zeeman beam once atoms have been sufficiently cooled and are accumulating in the MOT fields of the science chamber.
We note that while the principle functioning of the Zeeman slower only relies on the magnitude of the B-field along the solenoid, there is an interaction to be considered between the anti-Helmholtz MOT field and the decaying fringe fields of the Zeeman slower which can either lead to the fields adding or subtracting near the interface of the Zeeman and science chamber.
This subtle detail can have a large impact on trapping efficiency as we determined around 2014 when the current direction of the Neutral Zeeman slower was reversed from clockwise to anti-clockwise and we observed a 2x increase in trapped atom number at the conclusion of the blue MOT stage.

Once atoms have been slowed down to approx. 30 m/s we can capture using a magneto-optical trap (MOT) also working on the $^1S_0\,\rightarrow\,^3P_1$ transition. 
The optimal trapping frequency is tweaked for each isotope using our tunable sat. abs described in Sec. \hl{give ref}.
However, the typical detuning is approx $-3\Gamma/2 \approx -45$ MHz. 

MOT operation using this transition comes with the significant drawback that the Doppler temperature is relatively high at $T_D\approx1$ mK. 
The $J=0$ ground state of strontium also precludes the use of standard Sisyphus cooling techniques as there is only a single $m_J$ state available for bosonic strontium and far too many $m_F$ states in fermionic strontium.
Additionally, the $^1S_0\,\rightarrow\,^3P_1$ transition is not completely closed as shown in \;\ref{fig:energyLevels} resulting in population of the long-lived $^3P_2$ state. 
Fortunately, both of these obstacles are easily overcome.

The leak to the $^3P_2$ state results in population of magnetically trappable low-field seeking $m_j$ states. 
These atoms are trapped by the anti-Helmholtz field of the MOT and are dark to the 461 nm light \hl{natali refs (I think) [78, 79, 80, 65]}.
This allows us to take advantage of the long lifetime of the metastable $^3P_2$ state and accumulate a large number of atoms which can then be repumped back down to the $^1S_0$ ground state.
One drawback to this process is the long timescale required for a significant number of atoms to accumulate in the magnetic trap compared to the MOT.
However, the lifetime of the magnetic trap is typically limited by background pressure (approx. 15 - 25s) and therefore the maximum number of atoms which can be held by the magnetic trap is much greater than in the MOT. \hl{plots of loading between MOT and magnetic trap?}
On average, an atom will fall into the $^3P2$ state after scattering $10^5$ photons from the $^1S_0\,\rightarrow\,^3P_1$ transition and even then, only 2 out of 5 of the magnetic sub-levels are trappable.
Repumping is achieved via a 481 nm transition along the $(5s5p)^3P_2\,\rightarrow\,(5p^2)^3P2$ transition for approx. 50ms. 

Once the atoms have been returned to the ground state, we begin a second MOT stage using the narrow intercombination transition $^1S_0\,\rightarrow\,^3P_1$ to cool below 1 mK.
The $(5s5p)^3P_1$ state has a reasonably long lifetime of 21 $\mu$s ($\Gamma/2\pi=7.5$ kHz).
This long lifetime and near-IR wavelength transition has a Doppler limit of approx. \hl{450 nK??} and a recoil temperature of \hl{900 nK??}.
The narrow line MOT operates in a different regime compared to typical dipole allowed MOTs as the narrow linewidth means that only a thin shell of the atomic cloud is resonant at a given laser detuning and magnetic field value.
We can simulate the behavior of a broad transition by frequency modulating the 689 nm light using voltage controlled RF sources coupled to the light via an acouto-optic modulator (AOM). 
Additionally, we begin the narrow line cooling with the center frequency, amplitude of modulation, and laser intensity at large values in order to trap the initially hotter atoms from the blue MOT stage. 
As cooling with the 689 nm light becomes effective, we dynamically vary these three parameters along with the magnetic field gradient in order to cool the entire sample.
Ultimately, the MOT is reduced to single frequency operation at low laser intensity to and we achieve final temperatures between 1 - 2 $\mu$K after 400 ms of cooling.

During the last 50 - 100 ms of the 689 MOT (typically during single frequency operation) we additionally overlap the high intensity 1064 nm optical dipole trap (ODT).
The red MOT can then cool atoms into the typically 10 $\mu$K deep ODT with relative ease with transfer efficiencies as high as 75\%. 
Next, we extinguish the red MOT and allow a period of free evaporation for the sample to equilibrate in the ODT before beginning forced evaporative cooling to produce our final sample of ultracold or quantum degenerate gas.

The end of the evaporation typically marks the beginning of the experimental phase and the divergence of our protocol into the specific procedures necessary. 
These may include ramping or pulsing on lattice beams, exciting a collective mode, probing the gas with PAS laser, shelving, etc. 
Once we have completed the experimental phase, we measure the cloud characteristics via absorption imaging along the $^1S_0\,\rightarrow\,^1P_1$ transition. 
Typically we perform absorption imaging following a time-of-flight so as to measure both the atom number and temperature at the time of release. 
However, this is not strictly necessary and certain experiments may result in low atomic densities which are not amenable to a time-of-flight due to their low optical depth.

\subsection{Characteristic performance} \label{sec:benchmark_trapping}

The following subsections outline typical trapping parameters and performance for each isotope. Note, that while we have demonstrated the ability to dual trap 84 and 87, full characterization and optimization of this process is currently the subject of investigation.

The following is a table of daily measurements and selected values for evaluating the long-term performance of the apparatus.
This partial list is shown here to document those parameters which should be recorded on days the apparatus will performing trapping.
Some columns do not contain data as the requisite measurements have evolved over the years\footnote{The full spreadsheet is currently located at \texttt{KillianDrobo:\textbackslash Neutral\textbackslash Daily Statistics.xlsx}}.

\section{Vacuum system and atom source} \label{sec:vac}

\paragraph{Overview}
	
The Neutral apparatus is built around a custom stainless steel chamber positioned above the table to facilitate optical access. Typical pressures are in the ultrahigh vacuum regime, $<1\times10^{-10}$ torr. 
Details on the original construction can be found in Natali (App. A.10) and Pascal's theses \cite{MartinezdeEscolar2010,Mickelson2010b}. The master's of Francisco Camargo \cite{Camargo2015} outlines the construction of the similar Rydberg apparatus. This more recent apparatus has benefited from the many lessons learned during the early life of the Neutral experiment.
\newline

% Complete assembly
\noindent The vacuum system can be decomposed into several subcomponents, namely
\begin{enumerate}
\item Atom source (assembly of atom oven housed within the source chamber)
\item 2D collimator
\item Zeeman slower
\item Science chamber
\item Cryo tower
\end{enumerate}
Figure \ref{fig:vacuumSystem} shows a complete overview of these assemblies which form our vacuum system.

Note the red markers and green arrows denote the positions of heater bands and thermo-couples respectively. For more information please see App. \ref{app:breakingVacuum}.

		\label{fig:cryoTower}
	\end{figure}
From left to right, the system starts with an oven source based around a custom nozzle design which uses a rod heater to vaporize elemental strontium.
Next, there is a 6 way tee used for the optical molasses step which we refer to as the 2D collimator. 
From here atoms pass through a narrow differential pumping tube and into the entry port of the Zeeman slower where a majority of the laser cooling takes places. 
Following the Zeeman slower, atoms enter the science chamber where a plethora of lasers are used to manipulate and probe their behavior.
Chief among these are the MOT sequences and the high intensity far off-resonant optical dipole traps used for the final stage of confinement.
Lastly, the body of the science chamber is supported by the cryo tower which houses a titanium sublimation catridge (model: Varian 916-0061 series) and is the entry point for the Zeeman laser.
It is worth explicitly noting that this Zeeman window is necessarily directly opposite the atomic source and therefore is subject to a flux of hot atomic strontium which will eventually coat the vacuum side. A brief note on a possible solution to this problem is explored at the end of this section.

While the source and science chamber have remained largely unchanged since the publication of Natali's thesis, several key improvements and events have occurred over the last few years\footnote{As of April 2019, the most up to date CAD drawing for the Neutral apparatus is located at \texttt{KillianDrobo:\textbackslash Neutral\textbackslash Laboratory Systems\textbackslash Vacuum Chamber\textbackslash Neutral Chamber\textbackslash 2017.12.26\_strontiumvacuum35\_latticetable.dwg}. Additionally, please consult the README file located in this folder for further information.}.
These differences will be the subject of our discussion in the latter part of this section.


% Orientation of lasers to chamber 
Fig \hl{something} shows a closer view of the science chamber and defines a coordinate system as well as directional labels used throughout this thesis. 
We will use this reference when illustrating the orientation of various lasers through the science chamber to help the reader.
Furthermore, table \hl{something} lists the ports and their respective windows as of April 2019.
This table builds from table A.9 in Natali's thesis \cite{MartinezdeEscolar2010}.

The original drawings of these components can be found in App. A.10 of \cite{MartinezdeEscolar2010} along with detailed information of the window and ion gauge placements. 

\paragraph{Recent changes}
\subparagraph{Addition of platform:}
During the push to produce quantum degeneracy of strontium it was determined that different geometries of traps were necessary to achieve efficient forced evaporation. 
To this end, the task of redesigning the optical dipole traps was undertaken by Ying Huang and is detailed in her master's thesis \cite{Huang2013}. 
A raised platform was designed and built around the chamber to facilitate this project.
Unfortunately, while a major portion of this platform design is available in the main apparatus CAD file, the platform opposite of the oven is not documented.
Nor is there a complete assembly drawing incorporating the chamber and platform, which may confound future efforts to build around the chamber as more complexity is introduced. 

Currently, nearly every optical probe is launched from this raised platform.
This includes the 1064 nm bulk optical dipole trap and the 532 nm optical lattice, both of which are outlined below. 
During installation of the free space optical lattice we observed heating and hypothesized that relative movement of the platform and chamber may be a cause.
Supporting struts were then added beneath the chamber in an attempt to secure it to the platform around 2016.
However, the extreme sensitivity of cold atoms and occasional observation of shot to shot fluctuations persists the concern of relative movement between non-rigid components.

These concerns were reinforced when we observed increased stability once a partial cover was added over the platform optics for the optical dipole and lattice traps. 
Initially meant as an optical safety measure to enclose the high power beams, we noticed a marked decrease in the shot to shot fluctuations of the cloud position after a time of flight.
With further testing we were able to attribute the increased stability to a mitigation of air currents caused by close proximity of the platform optics to the ventilation system meant to thwart dust accumulation inside the experimental enclosure.

% Running out of strontium
\subparagraph{Running out of strontium:}
In the winter of 2017 the neutral apparatus had been under vacuum for approx 8 years when suddenly we were no longer able to trap a significant number of atoms \footnote{It is was expected any trapping loss due to low strontium would be gradual and we were not able to determine the cause of the abrupt behavior.}.
After extensive testing, we hypothesized that we had run out of elemental strontium within the atomic source.
This led us to break vacuum, reload strontium, and perform a light bakeout procedure to reestablish the requisite ultrahigh vacuum for experiments.
Details of this bakeout procedure can be found in App. \ref{app:breakingVacuum}. 
Through this process we confirmed our hypothesis that lack of strontium was the cause of the issue. 
Figure \ref{fig:2d_coll_flourescence} shows the atom beam fluorescence after refilling the oven.
This image was taken while using the Zeeman laser to cause photon scattering and looking down the 2D collimator.
	\begin{figure}
		\centerline{
		\includegraphics[height=0.5\textheight]{vacuum_IMG_20171103_184vacuum_230.jpg}}
		\caption{Typical fluorescence of Zeeman beam looking down 2D collimator}{This view is found using a 2 in mirror aligned along the path of the first pass of the 2D collimator (near mirror 3 in the diagram), looking down the collimator tube. While looking at this angle, we are able to see the Zeeman beam move across the atom column when moving the last turning mirror. Reduction in this fluorescence signal from that shown was the primary indicator of lack of strontium in the source.}
		\label{fig:2d_coll_flourescence}
	\end{figure}  
Prior to this event the Neutral apparatus enjoyed lifetimes of approx. 25s as measured by background lifetimes measurements within the IR optical dipole trap. 
Approximately a year after restoring vacuum we have measured lifetimes on the order of 15s, the cause of the discrepancy is not rigorously known. \hl{verify time, plot maybe?}

During the process of breaking vacuum we attempted several upgrades to the apparatus including adding a gate valve between the cryo tower and the Zeeman window as well as redesigning the atom nozzle source to incorporate a fixed heat shield around the heating element. 
Details of the nozzle design can also be found in App. \ref{app:breakingVacuum}.
Unfortunately, long lead times from vendors and a mistake in the nozzle construction led us to move forward and re-establish vacuum without these upgrades in place.

Finally, after removing the atom oven to replace strontium, we placed a temporary viewport to facilitate alignment of the Zeeman beam through the length of the vacuum system. 
While aligning we observed an unexpected partial occlusion of the Zeeman beam and upon further investigation learned that the differential pumping tube is noticeably not parallel to the atom trajectory.
We were not able to determine the severity of the misalignment since the tube is not easily accessible and replacement is problematic as the tube is attached to a copper gasket held between flanges connecting the atom source chamber and the 6-way tee of the 2D collimator. 
The main readily measurable symptom is the occlusion of the Zeeman beam which with an input power of approx. 120 mW before expansion optics and entering the chamber, only measures approx. 60 mW of transmitted power through the length of the vacuum system. 
A solution to bend the soft copper with a rod was proposed but abandoned due to concerns of cracking the thin copper.
As adequate repair of the tube necessitates a drastic and practically infeasible deconstruction of the vacuum system our goal here is to document the issue for future students.
It is currently hypothesized that this problem is the primary cause of the much longer load times needed in the Neutral apparatus compared to the newly designed Rydberg machine.

\paragraph{Clarifications from de Escobar thesis}

collimate 
% cryo tower
\subparagraph{HV version 1 \& 2:}
As a point of clarification, Natali's thesis \cite{MartinezdeEscolar2010} presents two versions of the HV chamber in figures A.42 - A.47 while referencing that the original construction proceeded with version 1. 
However, version 2 (the cryo tower) was installed around 2011 and is currently in use. Version 2 is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cryoTower} and details are available in the apparatus CAD drawing.

\subparagraph{Collimating array in nozzle:}
% hypodermic needle nozzle
Once more, Natali's thesis refers to the installation of an improved nozzle design incorporating an array of collimating tubes constructed from 2$\mu$ hypodermic needles (model: \hl{find}). 
Modeling and construction of this design was done by Anton Mazurenko, \cite{Mazurenko2010}, with the goal of improving the angular discrimination of the oven assembly to produce a more highly collimated beam of atoms.
Figure \ref{fig:2010_nozzle} shows the improved nozzle design \footnote{For reference, this nozzle design is labeled "new nozzle summer 2010" in the apparatus CAD file to distinguish it from the other nozzle drawings also present.}.
	\begin{figure}
		\centerline{
		\includegraphics[height=0.4\textheight]{vacuum_nozzle.jpg}}
		\caption{Atom oven and nozzle construction}{a) The nozzle through which vaporized strontium enters the experiment. Here we see the array of collimating tubes behind which solid strontium is packed. b) The complete oven construction which houses the cartridge heater and the nozzle at the tip.}
		\label{fig:2010_nozzle}
	\end{figure}
The original assembly of this oven also incorporated a heat shield that would insert over the construction shown in Fig. \ref{fig:2010_nozzle}b) but was ultimately abandoned since there was no way to fasten it to the flange which led the shield to fall off.
We hypothesized that lack of a heat shield led to uneven distribution of the thermal energy throughout the oven.
Therefore, fastening of the heat shield to the base flange was the primary goal of the redesign undertaken in late 2017 and further details can be found in App. \ref{app:breakingVacuum}.  
 
\paragraph{Ablating strontium off window} \label{p:ablatingSr}
While not directly related to any experiment or typical procedure, this sub-section summarizes a brief side project of using a pulsed 532 nm Verdi to ablate strontium from a vacuum window.
As discussed previously, a common problem faced by strontium experiments is the accumulation of strontium on the Zeeman entry port. 
These deposits may then act as a partial mirror leading to attentuation of the crucially important Zeeman beam. 
It was shared through private communication with professor Killian that pulsed 532 nm light (such as from a q-locked Verdi system used in the Plasma laboratory) might vaporize the strontium off the window and restore any loss in power. 
Using a test apparatus we were able to verify that indeed we could ablate the strontium off of a coated window, as shown in figure \ref{fig:ablating_strontium}.
	\begin{figure}
		\centerline{
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{vacuum_ablated_sr2.jpg}}
		\caption{Ablating strontium coating from window}{Comparison of the before (left) and after (right) when using a pulsed 532 nm Verdi to ablate strontium. The residue visible in the after image we believe to be caused by too high of an energy pulse which was reduced as we moved towards the center of the window.}
		\label{fig:ablating_strontium}
	\end{figure}
This promising test led us to install an optical traversal port, shown in figure, connecting the Plasma and Neutral labs. 
Unfortunately, while flashing the Verdi on a small section of the Neutral Zeeman window we found that the energy needed to ablate the strontium was accompanied by deformation of the optical surface.
We discontinued the ablation upon observing this behavior as we did not want to distort the optical beam front of the Zeeman front.
Instead, we replaced the window upon breaking vacuum as previously noted.
Additionally, in an effort to mitigate the time the window was exposed to the hot strontium beam, we installed a small servo motor to drive the atom shutter valve and integrated this mechanism into the experimental runtime. 
This allows the shutter to only be open during the times that we are actively trapping atoms. 
Details of the servo motor trigger integration into the neuKLEIN control system are available in App \hl{somewhere}.

\section{Laser systems}\label{sec:laser_systems}

The heart of any atomic physics experiment are the laser systems which are the basis for laser cooling and various probes.
Our lab has transitioned to mainly using diode lasers and we rely heavily upon the use of injection locked master - slave setups. \hl{ref}
Below we will outline the specifics of our light generation systems.
In particular, future experiments on the Neutral apparatus aim to explore quantum magnetism using strontium 87 and as such we will emphasize several key changes which have been made to the 461 locking and 689 trapping systems.

\subsection{Wideband cooling stage: 461 nm}
\label{ssec:461sys}

\subsubsection{Overview}
As discussed in the experimental overview, the majority of our laser cooling is done using 461 nm light. We generate and control these photons by amplifying and frequency doubling 922 nm light from a master ECDL diode laser. 
Fig.\ref{fig:461blockSys} shows an overview of how we generate the 461 nm light. 
We will cover the 922 master, Zeeman sub-system, and MOT sub-systems in detail below.
As we can see from the figure, the MOT sub-system is the basis for many different components of the overall 461 generation.
These separate systems will also be addressed in the MOT sub-system section below.
	\begin{figure}
		\centerline{
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{461_sys_overview.jpg}}

See Table \ref{tab:461AOM} for information on the AOMs. b) Relative frequencies at various stages of the 461 system.}
		\label{fig:461blockSys}
	\end{figure} 

In conjunction with the block diagram, Table \ref{tab:461AOM} shows the details of the frequency shifts and AOMs. The position of these AOMs is represented by the numbered black circles while the labeled red squares define the various system frequencies.
These frequency relations are schematically represented in Fig. \ref{fig:461blockSys}b) and can be recreated via Eq. \ref{eq:461freqs}.
Table \ref{tab:461AOM} gives defines the shift variables used in these equations.

Overall frequency control, $f_{922}$, is determined via the magnetically tunable saturated absorption cell.
This magnetic tunability to control the 461 nm light frequency is well documented in section 2.2.1 of Natali's thesis \cite{MartinezdeEscolar2010} and section 2.1.1 of Pascal's thesis \cite{Mickelson2010b}.
A more recent undergraduate project explored optimizations of this scheme for the Rydberg apparatus as well \cite{MichaelViray2014}.

\paragraph{Changing isotopes} \label{para:change_iso}
While the basic setup has not changed over the many years, we have recently moved away from the original current source based on a home built high-current FET amplifier to a Bi-polar current source (BOP) model blah. 
This change allows for more expansive coverage of the $^1S_0\,\rightarrow\,^3P_1$ isotopes shifts. The previous current source limited our dual trapping capability to 87+88, and required an AOM to be tweaked and the sat. abs. to be realigned for trapping 84 and 86. 
Using the BOP, we can now span the range of 84 and 87 within a single experimental cycle. 
However, trapping of 88 still requires the realignment of the sat. abs. 
Care should be taken when adjusting this alignment as the paths are highly coupled as can be seen in Fig \hl{blah}. 
Below we outline a straightforward algorithm for adjusting this alignment

\begin{enumerate}
\item Change the sat. abs AOM detuning using the potentiometer attached to the sat. abs. VCO. 
\item Peak up the AOM alignment
\item Fix alignment
\item Check depth of doppler profile
\item Lock 922 master
\item egin looking for atom flourescence in the chamber.
\item scan image freq
\item scan trapping freq

\end{enumerate}



\subsubsection{922 nm master}

The master is a Sacher Lynx 922 nm IR diode laser in a Littman Metcalf ECDL configuration. 
As shown in figure \hl{something}, the light from this diode is shaped and directed into a fiber optic cable (model?). 

Light is coupled into the fiber, then on the output goes through an AOM which detunes the diffracted order by (how much?). The diffracted and zeroth order are then separated with the unshifted beam sent towards the MOT generation subsystem and the shifted light towards the Zeeman subsystem.

The output of the 922 light has sideband directly on it from a high-pass filter coupled directly to the laser diode.

These sidebands are used to lock perform the PDH lcoking necessary for locking the cavity length. Once 461 nm light has been generated using the MOT subsystem, a small portion is picked off and used to interrogate a saturated absorption cell. Using frequency modulated Doppler-Free saturated absorption we generate an error signal which is used to complete the feedback loop and maintain the frequency position of the complete 461 nm system.
Figure outlines this process.

Throughout the course of this PhD, the Neutral 689 nm system has grown significantly and been almost entirely restructured. The master laser system is now shared between the Rydberg and Neutral laboratories and therefore a more modular approach was adopted to ensure independence of the labs experimental schedules. This process began with the replacement of our homemade Littman-Metcalf ECDL 689 master with a Toptica DL-Pro system. Additionally, at the time of this writing (spring 2019) we are currently in the process of migrating from the original high-finesse cavity used for the last 15 years \cite{Nagel2004} of the experiment to an ultra-low expansion cavity system. 

Our new approach to sharing the 689 light is based on fixing the lock point of the 689 light and fibering this fixed frequency light to the separate experiments. From this master fiber we utlize a series of AOM's to choose the correct frequency needed for the experiment at hand. This movement to a fiber based system culminated in the spring of 2018 when the Neutral apparatus significantly refactored our red system and transitioned to an entirely fiber based injection locking scheme. Optical fibers provide several key advantages when used to injection lock slaves, namely a much TEM00 output mode that can be easily mode-matched to the slave. Additionally, fibers provide a quick and effective means for ensuring optimal alignment of the injection locking light by coupling the rejected light from the slave diode "backwards" through the fiber. Although rejected light is typically minimized when setting up a slave diode, by temporarily placing a waveplate before the isolator you can scramble the input polarization and increase the rejected power to facilitate alignment through the fiber. This process generally results in a quite robust alignment of the fiber output and the laser diode and is much faster than the free space method of coupling over a long distance. This alignment advantage along with improved mode matching has allowed us to injection lock a slave diode with as little as 300 $\mu$W while producing up to 24 mW of usable output power.

The rest of this section will detail the setup of the 689 system including the master system and both boson and fermion subsystems used for narrowline cooling and spectroscopy.

\subsection{Optical dipole trap: 1064 nm} \label{ssec:1064sys}

save

Discuss how our only method for evaporative cooling is through light traps since we do not have a magnetically sensitive ground state.

Addres hisotry o laser and say that the current IPg died in fall of last year. 

How much power roughly is split between the arms? AOMs are back to back which couples the power stability of the two arms. This setup allows us to more fully utilize the available power from the IPG and in practice while two completely decoupled independent arms may add a slight complication, when accounted for this has generally not been a major source of concern. We have found it useful though to continously monitor the evaporation trajectory from shot to shot though. As a problem, say with a misbehaving power lock, along one arm may result in intensity fluctuations of both arms.

Several diffferent types of traps have been formed, ref Ying thesis. There are two paths split, named the loading arm and the sheet/dimple arm. Give stats on the loading path The loading path has the ability to be recycled on itself but we have not utilized this capability in many years due to complications of measuring the trap frequencies. 

The sheet/dimple arm can take two configurations as it's name suggests. The sheet trap is an approx. 400 x 40um sheet with the short axis parallel along gravity. This geometry is useful for the low densities needed for Sr 86 to minimize the effecs of three body recombination. Alternatively, by switching out a mirror we can direct this power

\subsubsection{Alignment Procedure} \label{sssec:1064_align}

Will focus on independent arm alignment of loading trap and sheet trap

Also useful to imagine three orthogonal axes with their origin set at the center of the chamber.

Need a figure showing the beam prop directions and the setup I'm envisioning.

%% Loading

From the figure, we see that the loading trap propagates primarily along the X-direction. We start by aligning loading trap since it is generally less sensitive and the ports that it goes through are equidistance from the ori

Can generally get away with centering vertically on the chamber windows. 

goal is to rotate about the center point, can verify this by equalizing the distance from the edge of the window on both sides of the chamber

Letting the atoms extend along a single dimension of the trap. 

Moving the red MOT up and down with the z-trim. Dynamic control of z-trim is useful here as you can define a loading b field value then a science b field value.

Use the shortpass dichoric mirrors to counter propagate a red loss beam. Alignment of the red beam follows the usual procedure making sure to reduce the exposure time and power as low as possible while maintaining a loss signal which should maximize alignment.

The sheet trap propagates primarily along the y-axis. This direction has one port extended away from the main chamber body due to the ion gauge. This can complicate the alignment. You

For peaking up the the sheet trap alignment, hit the red MOT with the loading trap, then extinguish the red MOT away and hold in the single arm loading trap for approx 10-20ms. This allows the red MOT to fall away and the atoms caught in the ODT will expand along the arm, mapping out the spatial profile. Once the untrapped atoms have fallen away, image the the atoms in situ (i.e. without a time-of-flight). With the spatial profile outlined you should be able to scan the sheet trap vertically looking for horizontal confinement along the loading trap. As the sheet is so tight along the vertical direction, this alignment is done using the last cylindrical lens before the chamber. 

Dimple trap follows the same process as the sheet alignment but there is a Newport Pico motor for finely adjusting instead of a lens.


\subsubsection{Trap frequency calibration} \label{sssec:1064_trap_freq}

Measurement of trap frequencies had previously relied upon parametric heating via intensity modulation of the optical dipole trap \hl{cite Ying thesis}. This process would observe atom loss via resonant heating when the modulation frequency matched a trap oscillation frequency. While this is a convenient and simple process it can lead to quite a complicated spectrum since the heating process does not discriminate directional information and may lead to coupling of higher harmonics of the trap frequencies. 

Cover both methods, moving the laser beam itself and snapping back or using the 532 beam to pull.

Primarily have used the kicking method for the measurement of trap frequencies using independent arm ODT (combination of the loading and sheet/dimple trap). 

With the recent addition of the high power 532 nm for the optical lattice, we have explored an alternative method of inducing a center-of-mass oscillation. This method uses a single pass of the green light purposely misaligned to the equilibrium position of the ODT to pull the atoms and excite an oscillation.

Give reference to section with theory but discuss the technical limitations
 
Absorption imaging is a destructive measurement process which is predicated on measuring the spatially distributed attenuation of laser light after passing through an atomic cloud. In this section we will discuss the technical details of the Neutral absorption system and reserve the theoretical description of the process to Sec.\ref{ssec:tof}. 

We must consider the bit depth of the camera's pixels, which in turn influences the number of photons (the intensity) we can illuminate the cloud with over a certain time. \hl{this must be related to the thinness of the sample right? Thick clouds also mean multiple scatters? Find someone that discusses this idea}.
 
The number of photons needs to be in a certain range, not to little but not too much. \hl{perhaps discuss the real world implication of counting photons (changing the exposure time)} 

This consideration means we generally aim for an optical depth around unity which is an order of magnitude difference the atom and background pulse. 

We use \hl{such and such} camera \hl{include datasheet in appendix since it is hard to find} which has a double shutter function. More details can be found in the appendix \hl{some sec}. We care about the timing since the laser intensity and frequency might drift between the atom and background images. Variations in intensity have straightforward implications for errors since the measurement of the atomic number density assumes the only difference between the images is due to the presence of scatters, Sec.\hl{some sec}, and does not account for fluctuating photon number. Very occasionally, the Neutral apparatus will experience an underexposed shot (of either the atom or background image) that must be discarded due to large, noticeable, fluctuations. We hypothesize that these occurrences are the result of environmental perturbations (acoustic noise, vibrations through the table, spurious ground or electrical noise). However, the precise cause is unknown as the absorption imaging happens very quickly at the end of the experimental cycle when multiple systems begin to reset for the next sequence and in practice, these fluctuations do not occur often enough to be a major cause for concern.

The more insidious source of error in absorption imaging is variation of the optical frequency. Coherent, frequency stabilized radiation is used to illuminate the atom cloud so that we may control the optical absorption cross section and accurately measure the atomic number density. However, this laser light is passed through many optical components on it's path to the atoms and ultimately the imaging camera. Small reflections along this path result in a multitude of interferometers which causes small scale spatial intensity variation across the beam. Exacerbating this problem are short time frequency drifts that may occur between the atom and background images which result in slightly different fringe patterns in the atom and background images. Fringes patterns are a well known nuisance in experimental AMO images and it has become routine to use linear algebra techniques to create a composite background image for each atom image during analysis \cite{Segal2009}. A brief discussion of the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm employed by the Neutral analysis routine is outlined below, while a more discussion can be found in Sec. \hl{some sec}. Briefly, this approach is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find a basis set of background images from a large set of raw background images.
\item For a single atom image, construct an initial guess at a composite background image using coefficients to weight each basis image resulting in a superposition of the basis images.
\item Segment the atom image into multiple regions by separating out the region of interest around the atom cloud.
\item Comparing similar regions between the composite background and the atom background region, perform a least-squares minimization by tweaking the weighting coefficients of the composite background.
\item Once a suitable composite background has been found, calculate the optical depth using the atomic region of interest and the corresponding region of the minimized composite background image.
\end{enumerate}
This procedure is repeated for each atom image using a static background basis set that is periodically recalculated using recent background images to account for long term drifts of the apparatus. may be numerically intensive as it is done for each atom image but the results have proven remarkable for even modest computational resources.
