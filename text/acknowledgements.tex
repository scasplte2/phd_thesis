It is difficult to over state how much I have learned during my time in grad school. Not only pertaining to physics, engineering, and computer science but also about myself, my friends, and my communities.

I owe so much to Brian DeSalvo for being an inspiration. It was Brian who showed me my first Bose-Einstein condensate 

I bugged him relentlessly as a naive undergraduate with so many questions.
