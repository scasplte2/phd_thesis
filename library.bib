abstract = {SU(N) symmetry can emerge in a quantum system with N single-particle spin states when spin is decoupled from inter-particle interactions. Here, we report a spectroscopic observation of SU(N ≤ 10) symmetry in (87)Sr taking advantage of the high measurement precision offered by an ultra-stable laser. By encoding the electronic orbital degree of freedom in two clock states, while keeping the system open to as many as 10 nuclear spin sublevels, we probe the non-equilibrium two-orbital SU(N) magnetism via Ramsey spectroscopy of atoms confined in an array of two-dimensional optical traps. We study the spin-orbital quantum dynamics and determine the relevant interaction parameters. This work lays the groundwork for using alkaline-earth atoms as test-beds for important orbital models.},

abstract = {Effective range theory, taking into account the polarisation interaction, is used for the extrapolation of the phaseshifts for the scattering of electrons by heavy alkali atoms to the region of thermal energies. The phaseshifts obtained are used for the calculation of impact broadening and the shift of Rydberg levels by alkali perturbers in the ground state. The parameters of the theory obtained from the ab initio calculations give a good description of the data on broadening and shift in the case of K and Rb. In the case of Cs the parameters have to be somewhat modified to give an agreement with experiment. The phaseshifts are also used for the calculation of the width and shift in the free-electron spin-resonance frequency due to collisions with heavy alkali atoms. The results of calculations are in good agreement with experimental data. The results for total and momentum transfer cross sections for the scattering of electrons with energies from 10 -4 to 10 -1 eV by K, Rb and Cs atoms are presented.},

abstract = {The interaction term in the Boltzmann equation for an ionized gas is expressed as the sum of two terms: a term of the usual form for close encounters and a diffusion term for distant encounters. Since distant encounters, producing small deflections, are more important than close encounters, consideration of only the diffusion term gives a reasonably good approximation in most cases and approaches exactness as the temperature increases or the density decreases. It is shown that in evaluating the coefficients in this diffusion term, the integral must be cut off at the Debye shielding distance, not at the mean interionic distance.The integro-differential equation obtained with the use of this diffusion term permits a more precise solution of the Boltzmann equation than is feasible with the Chapman-Cowling theory. While one pair of coefficients in this equation has been neglected, the remaining coefficients have all been evaluated, and the resultant equation solved numerically for the velocity distribution function in a gas of electrons and singly ionized atoms subject to a weak electrical field. Special techniques were required for this numerical integration, since solutions of the differential equation proved to be unstable in both directions. For high temperatures and low densities the computed electrical conductivity is about 60 percent of the value given by Cowling's second approximation.},

@article{zbs16,
abstract = {Ultracold atoms are an ideal platform to study strongly correlated phases of matter in and out of equilibrium. Much of the experimental progress in this field crucially relies on the control of the contact interaction between two atoms. Control of strong long-range interactions between distant ground state atoms has remained a long standing goal, opening the path towards the study of fundamentally new quantum many-body systems including frustrated or topological magnets and supersolids. Optical dressing of ground state atoms by near-resonant laser coupling to Rydberg states has been proposed as a versatile method to engineer such interactions. However, up to now the great potential of this approach for interaction control in a many-body setting has eluded experimental confirmation. Here we report the realisation of coherent Rydberg-dressing in an ultracold atomic lattice gas and directly probe the induced interaction potential using an interferometric technique with single atom sensitivity. We use this approach to implement a two-dimensional synthetic spin lattice and demonstrate its versatility by tuning the range and anisotropy of the effective spin interactions. Our measurements are in remarkable agreement with exact solutions of the many-body dynamics, providing further evidence for the high degree of accurate interaction control in these systems. Finally, we identify a collective many-body decay process, and discuss possible routes to overcome this current limitation of coherence times. Our work marks the first step towards the use of laser-controlled Rydberg interactions for the study of exotic quantum magnets in optical lattices.},

abstract = {Motivated by the recent experimental success in realizing synthetic spin-orbit coupling in ultracold atomic systems, we consider N-component atoms coupled to a non-Abelian SU(N) gauge field. More specifically, we focus on the case, referred to here as "SU(3) spin-orbit-coupling," where the internal states of three-component atoms are coupled to their momenta via a matrix structure that involves the Gell-Mann matrices (in contrast to the Pauli matrices in conventional SU(2) spin-orbit-coupled systems). It is shown that the SU(3) spin-orbit-coupling gives rise to qualitatively different phenomena and in particular we find that even a homogeneous SU(3) field on a simple square lattice enables a topologically non-trivial state to exist, while such SU(2) systems always have trivial topology. In deriving this result, we first establish an exact equivalence between the Hofstadter model with a 1/N Abelian flux per plaquette and a homogeneous SU(N) non-Abelian model. The former is known to have a topological spectrum for N{\textgreater}2, which is thus inherited by the latter. It is explicitly verified by an exact calculation for N=3, where we develop and use a new algebraic method to calculate topological indices in the SU(3) case. Finally, we consider a strip geometry and establish the existence of three gapless edge states -- the hallmark feature of such an SU(3) topological insulator.},

The ISB are a manifestation of the strong interactions that occur between atoms confined in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry and disappear when the confinement is relaxed along one dimension.

abstract = {We apply the functional renormalisation group to few-nucleon systems. Our starting point is a local effective action that includes three- and four-nucleon interactions, expressed in terms of nucleon and two-nucleon boson fields. The evolution of the coupling constants in this action is described by a renormalisation group flow. We derive these flow equations both in the limit of exact Wigner SU(4) symmetry and in the realistic case of broken symmetry. In the symmetric limit we find that the renormalisation flow equations decouple, and can be combined into two sets, one of which matches the known results for bosons, and the other result matches the one for fermions with spin degrees only. The equations show universal features in the unitary limit, which is obtained when the two-body scattering length tends to infinity. We calculate the spin-quartet neutron-deuteron scattering length and the deuteron-deuteron scattering lengths in the spin-singlet and quintet channels.},

abstract = {Superconducting correlations may propagate between two superconductors separated by a tiny insulating or metallic barrier, allowing a dissipationless electric current to flow. In the presence of a magnetic field, the maximum supercurrent oscillates and each oscillation corresponding to the entry of one Josephson vortex into the barrier. Josephson vortices are conceptual blocks of advanced quantum devices such as coherent terahertz generators or qubits for quantum computing, in which on-demand generation and control is crucial. Here, we map superconducting correlations inside proximity Josephson junctions using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Unexpectedly, we find that such Josephson vortices have real cores, in which the proximity gap is locally suppressed and the normal state recovered. By following the Josephson vortex formation and evolution we demonstrate that they originate from quantum interference of Andreev quasiparticles, and that the phase portraits of the two superconducting quantum condensates at edges of the junction decide their generation, shape, spatial extent and arrangement. Our observation opens a pathway towards the generation and control of Josephson vortices by applying supercurrents through the superconducting leads of the junctions, that is, by purely electrical means without any need for a magnetic field, which is a crucial step towards high-density on-chip integration of superconducting quantum devices.},

abstract = {We develop an approach to generate finite-range atomic interactions via optical Rydberg-state excitation and study the underlying excitation dynamics in theory and experiment. In contrast to previous work, the proposed scheme is based on resonant optical driving and the establishment of a dark state under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Analyzing the driven dissipative dynamics of the atomic gas, we show that the interplay between coherent light coupling, radiative decay and strong Rydberg-Rydberg atom interactions leads to the emergence of sizeable effective interactions while providing remarkably long coherence times. The latter are studied experimentally in a cold gas of strontium atoms for which the proposed scheme is most efficient. Our measured atom loss is in agreement with the theoretical prediction based on binary effective interactions between the driven atoms.},

abstract = {When atoms in a gas are cooled to extremely low temperatures, they will-under the appropriate conditions-condense into a single quantum-mechanical state known as a Bose-Einstein condensate. In such systems, quantum-mechanical behaviour is evident on a macroscopic scale. Here we explore the dynamics of how a Bose-Einstein condensate collapses and subsequently explodes when the balance of forces governing its size and shape is suddenly altered. A condensate's equilibrium size and shape is strongly affected by the interatomic interactions. Our ability to induce a collapse by switching the interactions from repulsive to attractive by tuning an externally applied magnetic field yields detailed information on the violent collapse process. We observe anisotropic atom bursts that explode from the condensate, atoms leaving the condensate in undetected forms, spikes appearing in the condensate wavefunction and oscillating remnant condensates that survive the collapse. All these processes have curious dependences on time, on the strength of the interaction and on the number of condensate atoms. Although the system would seem to be simple and well characterized, our measurements reveal many phenomena that challenge theoretical models.},

The conditions under which a Mott insulating region can melt, and the local density adjust to the new potential, are determined. In the case of a suddenly switched potential, it is found that the Mott insulator stays insulating and the density will not adjust if the quench is too abrupt. This comes about because too rapid currents result in Umklapp-type current reversals. For a stirrer moved through a Mott insulating cloud, it is seen that only if the velocity is comparable to the time scale set by the tunneling, will the Mott insulator be affected.},

Blockade has been observed for electrons1, 2, 3, photons4 and cold atoms5. Furthermore, dipolar interactions between highly excited atoms have been proposed as a mechanism for 'Rydberg blockade'6, 7, which might provide a novel approach to a number of quantum protocols8, 9, 10, 11. Dipolar interactions between Rydberg atoms were observed several decades ago12 and have been studied recently in a many-body regime using cold atoms13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. However, to harness Rydberg blockade for controlled quantum dynamics, it is necessary to achieve strong interactions between single pairs of atoms. Here, we demonstrate that a single Rydberg-excited rubidium atom blocks excitation of a second atom located more than 10 m away. The observed probability of double excitation is less than 20{\%}, consistent with a theoretical model of the Rydberg interaction augmented by Monte Carlo simulations that account for experimental imperfections.},

abstract = {A charged particle traversing a plasma loses its energy to both plasma electrons and ions. We compute the energy partition, the fractions {\$}E{\_}e/E{\_}0{\$} and {\$}E{\_}\backslashbackslashsmI/E{\_}0{\$} of the initial energy {\$}E{\_}0{\$} of this `impurity particle' that are deposited into the electrons and ions when it has slowed down into an equilibrium distribution that we shall determine. We use a well-defined Fokker-Planck equation for the phase space distribution of the charged impurity particles in a weakly to moderately coupled plasma. The Fokker-Planck equation holds to first sub-leading order in the dimensionless plasma coupling constant, which means we compute to order {\$}n\backslashbackslashln n{\$} (leading) and {\$}n{\$} (sub-leading) in the plasma density {\$}n{\$}. Previously, the order {\$}n{\$} terms had been estimated, not calculated. Since the charged particle does not come to rest, the energy loss obtained by an integration of a {\$}dE/dx{\$} has an ambiguity of order of the plasma temperature. Our Fokker-Planck formulation provides an unambiguous, precise definition of the energy fractions. For equal electron and ion temperatures, we find that our precise results agree well with a fit obtained by Fraley, Linnebur, Mason, and Morse. The case with differing electron and ion temperatures, a case of great importance for nuclear fusion, will be investigated in detail in the present paper. The energy partitions for this general case, partitions that have not been obtained before, will be presented. We find that now the proper solution of the Fokker-Planck equation yields a quasi-static equilibrium distribution to which fast particles relax that has neither the electron nor the ion temperature. This "schizophrenic" final ensemble of slowed particles gives a new mechanism to bring the electron and ion temperatures together. The rate at which this new mechanism brings the electrons and ions in the plasma into thermal equilibrium will be computed.},

abstract = {Photoionization of trapped atoms is a recent technique for creating ion beams with low transverse temperature. The temporal behavior of the current that can be extracted from such an ultracold ion source is measured when operating in the pulsed mode. A number of experimental parameters are varied to find the conditions under which the time-averaged current is maximized. A dynamic model of the source is developed that agrees quite well with the experimental observations. The radiation pressure exerted by the excitation laser beam is found to substantially increase the extracted current. For a source volume with a typical root-mean-square radius of20 {\$}\mu{\$} m, a maximum peak current of 88 pA is observed, limited by the available ionization laser power of 46 mW. The optimum time-averaged current is 13 pA at a 36{\%} duty cycle. Particle-tracking simulations show that stochastic heating strongly reduces the brightness of the ion beam at higher current for the experimental conditions.},

abstract = {Understanding the rich behavior that emerges from systems of interacting quantum particles, such as electrons in materials, nucleons in nuclei or neutron stars, the quark-gluon plasma, and superfluid liquid helium, requires investigation of systems that are clean, accessible, and have tunable parameters. Ultracold quantum gases offer tremendous promise for this application largely due to an unprecedented control over interactions. Specifically, {\$}a{\$}, the two-body scattering length that characterizes the interaction strength, can be tuned to any value. This offers prospects for experimental access to regimes where the behavior is not well understood because interactions are strong, atom-atom correlations are important, mean-field theory is inadequate, and equilibrium may not be reached or perhaps does not even exist. Of particular interest is the unitary gas, where {\$}a{\$} is infinite, and where many aspects of the system are universal in that they depend only on the particle density and quantum statistics. While the unitary Fermi gas has been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical investigation, the degenerate unitary Bose gas has generally been deemed experimentally inaccessible because of three-body loss rates that increase dramatically with increasing {\$}a{\$}. Here, we investigate dynamics of a unitary Bose gas for timescales that are short compared to the loss. We find that the momentum distribution of the unitary Bose gas evolves on timescales fast compared to losses, and that both the timescale for this evolution and the limiting shape of the momentum distribution are consistent with universal scaling with density. This work demonstrates that a unitary Bose gas can be created and probed dynamically, and thus opens the door for further exploration of this novel strongly interacting quantum liquid.},

Our scheme allows one to realize both coherent as well as dissipative dynamics of complex spin models involving many-body interactions and constraints. The central building block of the simulation scheme is constituted by a mesoscopic Rydberg gate that permits the entanglement of several atoms in an efficient, robust and quick protocol. In addition, optical pumping on ancillary atoms provides the dissipative ingredient for engineering the coupling between the system and a tailored environment. As an illustration, we discuss how the simulator enables the simulation of coherent evolution of quantum spin models such as the two-dimensional Heisenberg model and Kitaev's toric code, which involves four-body spin interactions. We moreover show that in principle also the simulation of lattice fermions can be achieved. As an example for controlled dissipative dynamics, we discuss ground cooling of frustration-free spin Hamiltonians. Finally, we briefly review a recent experiment, which has demonstrated the basic building blocks of an open-system quantum simulator for a linear system of trapped ions.},

We consider SU(3)-symmetric attractive interactions and also eventually include a three-body constraint, which mimics the effect of three-body losses in the strong-loss regime. We combine exact diagonalization with the Lanczos algorithm, and evaluate both the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of the problem. In D=1, we find that the ground state is always a three-body bound state (trion) for arbitrarily small interaction, while in D=2, due to the stronger influence of finite-size effects, we are not able to provide conclusive evidence of the existence of a finite threshold for trion formation. Our data are however compatible with a threshold value which vanishes logarithmically with the size of the system. Moreover we are able to identify the presence of a fine structure inside the spectrum, which is associated with off-site trionic states. The characterization of these states shows that only the long-distance behavior of the eigenstate wavefunctions provides clear-cut signatures about the nature of bound states and that onsite observables are not enough to discriminate between them. The inclusion of a three-body constraint due to losses promotes these off-site trions to the role of lowest energy states, at least in the strong-coupling regime.},

abstract = {Ultracold atoms trapped by light offer robust quantum coherence and controllability, providing an attractive system for quantum information processing and for the simulation of complex problems in condensed matter physics. Many quantum information processing schemes require the manipulation and deterministic entanglement of individual qubits; this would typically be accomplished using controlled, state-dependent, coherent interactions among qubits. Recent experiments have made progress towards this goal by demonstrating entanglement among an ensemble of atoms confined in an optical lattice. Until now, however, there has been no demonstration of a key operation: controlled entanglement between atoms in isolated pairs. Here we use an optical lattice of double-well potentials to isolate and manipulate arrays of paired (87)Rb atoms, inducing controlled entangling interactions within each pair. Our experiment realizes proposals to use controlled exchange coupling in a system of neutral atoms. Although 87Rb atoms have nearly state-independent interactions, when we force two atoms into the same physical location, the wavefunction exchange symmetry of these identical bosons leads to state-dependent dynamics. We observe repeated interchange of spin between atoms occupying different vibrational levels, with a coherence time of more than ten milliseconds. This observation demonstrates the essential component of a neutral atom quantum SWAP gate (which interchanges the state of two qubits). Its 'half-implementation', the root SWAP gate, is entangling, and together with single-qubit rotations it forms a set of universal gates for quantum computation.},

abstract = {We analytically calculate the spatial nonlocal pair correlation function for an interacting uniform 1D Bose gas at finite temperature and propose an experimental method to measure nonlocal correlations. Our results span six different physical realms, including the weakly and strongly interacting regimes. We show explicitly that the characteristic correlation lengths are given by one of four length scales: the thermal de Broglie wavelength, the mean interparticle separation, the healing length, or the phase coherence length. In all regimes, we identify the profound role of interactions and find that under certain conditions the pair correlation may develop a global maximum at a finite interparticle separation due to the competition between repulsive interactions and thermal effects.},

Using an adiabatic hyperfine analysis, we calculate and compare a model spectra for J = 1, 2, 3, and 4 features of the Na{\~{}} ' II " (v = 48) state to recent high resolution experimental data.

When the kinetic energy e of two colliding ground state atoms plus photon energy fi, {\~{}} of a tunable laser matches the energy difference between an excited bound level b and the asymptotic ground state energy, photoexcitation will result in level b, appearing as a scattering resonance. If the bound level decays to some product state p, which is detected as a function of A, {\~{}}, the resulting spectrum maps out the positions of the excited bound levels b. Because the thermal energy k{\&}T of trapped atoms is typically close to the natural linewidth of the atomic cooling transition, the high resolution photoassociation spectrum exhibits only slight thermal broadening. Using a Breit-Wigner resonance scattering treatment and assuming that the natural width y (in energy units) of the resonances was small compared to kBT, Thorsheim, Weiner, and Julienne obtained a thermally averaged spectrum for Na atoms at 10 mK. Since T (1 mK in magneto-optical trap (MOT) [2 — 4] and far off-resonance trap (FORT) [5] experiments, we present a new treatment of the line shapes for photoassociation spectra valid even when k{\&}T {\~{}} y. Recently, 1 MHz resolution line shapes have been reported for both Na [2] and Rb [5] photoassociative spectra. These ultra-cold experiments confirm the prediction that detailed information on the ground state potential and scattering wave function can be obtained from line shapes and intensity patterns.

Non-exponential decay towards equilibrium for the average velocity of a tagged population of ions heralds non-Markovian dynamics and a breakdown of assumptions underlying standard kinetic theory. We prove the equivalence of the average-velocity curve to the velocity autocorrelation function, a fundamental statistical quantity that provides access to equilibrium transport coefficients and aspects of individual particle trajectories in a regime where experimental measurements have been lacking. From our data, we calculate the ion self-diffusion constant.

abstract = {A dynamical many-body theory of single color photoassociation in a Bose-Einstein condensate is presented. The theory describes the time evolution of a condensed atomic ensemble under the influence of an arbitrarily varying near-resonant laser pulse, which strongly modifies the binary scattering properties. In particular, when considering situations with rapid variations and high light intensities the approach described in this article leads, in a consistent way, beyond standard mean-field techniques. This allows one to address the question of limits to the photoassociation rate due to many-body effects which has caused extensive discussions in the recent past. Both the possible loss rate of condensate atoms and the amount of stable ground-state molecules achievable within a certain time are found to be stronger limited than according to mean-field theory. By systematically treating the dynamics of the connected Green's function for pair correlations the resonantly driven population of the excited molecular state as well as scattering into the continuum of noncondensed atomic states are taken into account. A detailed analysis of the low-energy stationary scattering properties of two atoms modified by the near resonant photoassociation laser, in particular of the dressed state spectrum of the relative motion prepares for the analysis of the many-body dynamics. The consequences of the finite lifetime of the resonantly coupled bound state are discussed in the two-body as well as in the many-body context. Extending the two body description to scattering in a tight trap reveals the modifications to the near resonant adiabatic dressed levels caused by the decay of the excited molecular state.},

Recent numerical simulations and experiments have shown how they can arise from the encounter of two collisionless plasma shells. When the shells interpenetrate, the overlapping region turns unstable, triggering the shock formation. As a first step towards a microscopic understanding of the process, we analyze here in detail the initial instability phase. On the one hand, 2D relativistic PIC simulations are performed where two symmetric initially cold pair plasmas collide. On the other hand, the instabilities at work are analyzed, as well as the field at saturation and the seed field which gets amplified. For mildly relativistic motions and onward, Weibel modes govern the linear phase. We derive an expression for the duration of the linear phase in good agreement with the simulations. This saturation time constitutes indeed a lower-bound for the shock formation time.},

The finite duration of encounters is taken into account in a self‐consistent fashion which includes collective effects. The concomitant processes of absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation are investigated and in particular the bremsstrahlung emission and absorption coefficients near the plasma frequency are given. The conversion of longitudinal to transverse waves by scattering from ions is discussed.},

abstract = {Concepts underlying the Enskog kinetic theory of hard-spheres are applied to include short-range correlation effects in a model for transport coefficients of strongly coupled plasmas. The approach is based on an extension of the effective potential transport theory [S. D. Baalrud and J. Daligault, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 235001 (2013)] to include an exclusion radius surrounding individual charged particles that is associated with Coulomb repulsion. This is obtained by analogy with thefinite size of hard spheres inEnskog's theory. Predictions for the self-diffusion and shear viscosity coefficients of the one-component plasma are tested against molecular dynamics simulations. The theory is found to accurately capture the kinetic contributions to the transport coefficients, but not the potential contributions that arise at very strong coupling (? ? 30). Considerations related to a first-principles generalization of Enskog's kinetic equation to continuous potentials are also discussed.},

@article{jrf04,
abstract = {This article provides an overview of the basic principles of the physics of quantum halo systems, defined as bound states of clusters of particles with a radius extending well into classically forbidden regions. Exploiting the consequences of this definition, the authors derive the conditions for occurrence in terms of the number of clusters, binding energy, angular momentum, cluster charges, and excitation energy. All these quantities must be small. The article discusses the transitions between different cluster divisions and the importance of thresholds for cluster or particle decay, with particular attention to the Efimov effect and the related exotic states. The pertinent properties can be described by the use of dimensionless variables. Then universal and specific properties can be distinguished, as shown in a series of examples selected from nuclear, atomic, and molecular systems. The neutron dripline is especially interesting for nuclei and negative ions for atoms. For molecules, in which the cluster division comes naturally, a wider range of possibilities exists. Halos in two dimensions have very different properties, and their states are easily spatially extended, whereas Borromean systems are unlikely and spatially confined. The Efimov effect and the Thomas collapse occur only for dimensions between 2.3 and 3.8 and thus not for 2. High-energy reactions directly probe the halo structure. The authors discuss the reaction mechanisms for high-energy nuclear few-body halo breakup on light, intermediate, and heavy nuclear targets. For light targets, the strong interaction dominates, while for heavy targets, the Coulomb interaction dominates. For intermediate targets these processes are of comparable magnitude. As in atomic and molecular physics, a geometric impact-parameter picture is very appropriate. Finally, the authors briefly consider the complementary processes involving electroweak probes available through beta decay, electromagnetic transitions, and capture reactions.},

The atoms are detected with a high-finesse optical cavity and single atom transits are identified. An atom laser beam is formed by continuously output coupling atoms from the Bose-Einstein condensate. We investigate the full counting statistics of this beam and measure its second order correlation function g((2))(tau) in a Hanbury Brown-Twiss type experiment. For the monoenergetic atom laser we observe a constant correlation function g((2))(tau)=1.00 +/- 0.01 and an atom number distribution close to a Poissonian statistics. A pseudothermal atomic beam shows a bunching behavior and a Bose distributed counting statistics.},

The spin degrees of freedom of ultracold neutral atoms in their ground electronic state provide a natural platform for such applications thanks to their long coherence times and the ability to control them with magneto-optical fields. However, the creation of strong coherent coupling between spins has been challenging. Here we demonstrate a strong and tunable Rydberg-dressed interaction between spins of individually trapped caesium atoms with energy shifts of order 1 MHz in units of Planck[rsquor]s constant. This interaction leads to a ground-state spin-flip blockade, whereby simultaneous hyperfine spin flips of two atoms are inhibited owing to their mutual interaction. We employ this spin-flip blockade to rapidly produce single-step Bell-state entanglement between two atoms with a fidelity [ge]81(2){\%}.},

abstract = {Interfacing light and matter at the quantum level is at the heart of modern atomic and optical physics and enables new quantum technologies involving the manipulation of single photons and atoms. A prototypical atom-light interface is electromagnetically induced transparency, in which quantum interference gives rise to hybrid states of photons and atoms called dark-state polaritons. We have observed individual dark-state polaritons as they propagate through an ultracold atomic gas involving Rydberg states. Strong long-range interactions between Rydberg atoms give rise to an effective interaction blockade for dark-state polaritons, which results in large optical nonlinearities and modified polariton number statistics. The observed statistical fluctuations drop well below the quantum noise limit indicating that photon correlations modified by the strong interactions have a significant back-action on the Rydberg atom statistics.},

The density dependence of these effects is investigated in detail for the S- and P-Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers n∼60 and n∼80 excited by narrow-band continuous-wave laser light.

Key is the strong spin-orbit interaction between the c{\^{}}3$\backslash$Pi{\_}u, A{\^{}}1$\backslash$Sigma{\_}u{\^{}}+ and B{\^{}}1$\backslash$Sigma{\_}u{\^{}}+ states. It creates not only an effective dipole moment allowing free-to-bound transitions near the {\^{}}1S + {\^{}}3P{\_}1 intercombination line but also facilitates bound-to-bound transitions via resonantly coupled excited state rovibrational levels to deeply bound rovibrational levels of the ground X{\^{}}1$\backslash$Sigma{\_}g{\^{}}+ potential, with v" as low as v"=6. The spin-orbit interaction is responsible for both optical pathways. Therefore, those excited state levels that have the largest bound-to-bound transition moments to deeply bound ground state levels also exhibit a sufficient photoassociation probability, comparable to that of the lowest weakly bound excited state level previously observed by Zelevinsky et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 203201 (2006)]. Our study paves the way for an efficient photoassociative production of Sr{\_}2 molecules in ground state levels suitable for experiments testing the electron-to-proton mass ratio.},

abstract = {We present a theory of a degenerate atomic Fermi gas, interacting through a narrow Feshbach resonance, whose position and therefore strength can be tuned experimentally, as demonstrated recently in ultracold trapped atomic gases. The distinguishing feature of the theory is that its accuracy is controlled by a dimensionless parameter proportional to the ratio of the width of the resonance to Fermi energy. The theory is therefore quantitatively accurate for a narrow Feshbach resonance. In the case of a narrow s-wave resonance, our analysis leads to a quantitative description of the crossover between a weakly paired BCS superconductor of overlapping Cooper pairs and a strongly paired molecular Bose–Einstein condensate of diatomic molecules. In the case of pairing via a p-wave resonance, that we show is always narrow for a sufficiently low density, we predict a detuning-temperature phase diagram, that in the course of a BCS–BEC crossover can exhibit a host of thermodynamically distinct phases separated by quantum and classical phase transitions. For an intermediate strength of the dipolar anisotropy, the system exhibits a px + ipy paired superfluidity that undergoes a topological phase transition between a weakly coupled gapless ground state at large positive detuning and a strongly paired fully gapped molecular superfluid for a negative detuning. In two dimensions the former state is characterized by a Pfaffian ground state exhibiting topological order and non-Abelian vortex excitations familiar from fractional quantum Hall systems.},

Cold sodium atoms are trapped in a far-detuned standing wave of light that is accelerated for a controlled duration. For a large acceleration the atoms can escape the trapping potential via tunneling. Initially the number of trapped atoms shows strong nonexponential decay features, evolving into the characteristic exponential decay behavior. We repeatedly measure the number of atoms remaining trapped during the initial period of nonexponential decay. Depending on the frequency of measurements we observe a decay that is suppressed or enhanced as compared to the unperturbed system.},

abstract = {In theory, the decay of any unstable quantum state can be inhibited by sufficiently frequent measurements--the quantum Zeno effect. Although this prediction has been tested only for transitions between two coupled, essentially stable states, the quantum Zeno effect is thought to be a general feature of quantum mechanics, applicable to radioactive or radiative decay processes. This generality arises from the assumption that, in principle, successive observations can be made at time intervals too short for the system to change appreciably. Here we show not only that the quantum Zeno effect is fundamentally unattainable in radiative or radioactive decay (because the required measurement rates would cause the system to disintegrate), but also that these processes may be accelerated by frequent measurements. We find that the modification of the decay process is determined by the energy spread incurred by the measurements (as a result of the time-energy uncertainty relation), and the distribution of states to which the decaying state is coupled. Whereas the inhibitory quantum Zeno effect may be feasible in a limited class of systems, the opposite effect--accelerated decay--appears to be much more ubiquitous.},

Our scheme employs either lattice modulation or laser-induced tunneling to reduce or turn off two-body interactions in a rotating frame, promoting three-body interactions arising from multi-orbital physics to leading-order processes. This approach provides a route to strongly-correlated phases of lattice gases that are beyond the reach of previously proposed dissipative three-body interactions. In particular, we study the mean-field phase diagram for spinless bosons with three- and two- body interactions, and provide a roadmap to dimer states of varying character in 1D. This new toolset should be immediately applicable in state-of-the-art cold atom experiments.},

STIRAP is performed near the narrow (1)S(0)-(3)P(1) intercombination transition, using a vibrational level of the 1(0(u)(+)) potential as an intermediate state. In preparation of our molecule association scheme, we have determined the binding energies of the last vibrational levels of the 1(0(u)(+)), 1(1(u)) excited-state and the X (1)$\Sigma$(g)(+) ground-state potentials. Our work overcomes the previous limitation of STIRAP schemes to systems with magnetic Feshbach resonances, thereby establishing a route that is applicable to many systems beyond alkali-metal dimers.},

abstract = {We investigate the out-of-equilibrium behavior of a dissipative gas of Rydberg atoms that features a dynamical transition between two stationary states characterized by different excitation densities. We determine the structure and properties of the phase diagram and identify the universality class of the transition, both for the statics and the dynamics. We show that the proper dynamical order parameter is in fact not the excitation density and find evidence that the dynamical transition is in the “model ” universality class; i.e., it features a nontrivial symmetry and a dynamics with nonconserved order parameter. This sheds light on some relevant and observable aspects of dynamical transitions in Rydberg gases. In particular it permits a quantitative understanding of a recent experiment [C. Carr, Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 113901 (2013)] which observed bistable behavior as well as power-law scaling of the relaxation time. The latter emerges not due to critical slowing down in the vicinity of a second order transition, but from the nonequilibrium dynamics near a so-called spinodal line.},

Recently, phase transitions to ordered structures have been predicted for gases of highly excited, 'frozen' Rydberg atoms. Such Rydberg crystals are a model for dilute metallic solids with tunable lattice parameters, and provide access to a wide variety of fundamental phenomena. We investigate theoretically how such structures can be created in four distinct cold atomic systems, by using tailored laser excitation in the presence of strong Rydberg–Rydberg interactions. We study in detail the experimental requirements and limitations for these systems and characterize the basic properties of small crystalline Rydberg structures in one, two and three dimensions.},

At low temperatures, the viscosity has a universal quantum scale ħ n, where n is the density and ħ is Planck's constant h divided by 2{\$}\pi{\$}, whereas at high temperatures the natural scale is pT3/ħ2, where pT is the thermal momentum. We used breathing mode damping to measure the shear viscosity at low temperature. At high temperature T, we used anisotropic expansion of the cloud to find the viscosity, which exhibits precise T3/2 scaling. In both experiments, universal hydrodynamic equations including friction and heating were used to extract the viscosity. We estimate the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density and compare it with that of a perfect fluid.},

Because atoms scattered into higher bands do not thermalize on the time scale of typical experiments, this process cannot be described by the total energy increase in the system alone (which is determined by single-particle effects). The heating instead involves an important interplay between the atomic physics of the heating process and the many-body physics of the state. We characterize the effects on many-body states for various system parameters, where we observe important differences in the heating for strongly and weakly interacting regimes, as well as a strong dependence on the sign of the laser detuning from the excited atomic state. We compute heating rates and changes to characteristic correlation functions based on both perturbation-theory calculations and a time-dependent calculation of the dissipative many-body dynamics. The latter is made possible for one-dimensional systems by combining time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group methods with quantum trajectory techniques.},

From our images, we fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions with theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them, even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature, owing to a proliferation of local defects. The ability to resolve individual lattice sites directly opens up new avenues for the manipulation, analysis and applications of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice. For example, one could introduce local perturbations or access regions of high entropy, a crucial requirement for the implementation of novel cooling schemes.},

Donley et al., Nature (London) 417, 529 (2002)] an initially pure condensate of 85Rb atoms was exposed to a specially designed time-dependent magnetic-field pulse in the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance. The production of additional components of the gas as well as their oscillatory behavior have been reported. We apply a microscopic theory of the gas to identify these components and determine their physical properties. Our time-dependent studies allow us to explain the observed dynamic evolution of all fractions, and to identify the physical relevance of the pulse shape. Based on ab initio predictions, our theory strongly supports the view that the experiments have produced a molecular condensate.},

abstract = {The observation of the superfluid to Mott insulator phase transition of ultracold atoms in optical lattices was an enabling discovery in experimental many-body physics, providing the first tangible example of a quantum phase transition (one that occurs even at zero temperature) in an ultracold atomic gas. For a trapped gas, the spatially varying local chemical potential gives rise to multiple quantum phases within a single sample, complicating the interpretation of bulk measurements. Here we report spatially resolved, in-situ imaging of a two-dimensional ultracold atomic gas as it crosses the superfluid to Mott insulator transition, providing direct access to individual characteristics of the insulating, superfluid and normal phases. We present results for the local compressibility in all phases, observing a strong suppression in the insulator domain and suppressed density fluctuations for the Mott insulator, in accordance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Furthermore, we obtain a direct measure of the finite temperature of the system. Taken together, these methods enable a complete characterization of multiple phases in a strongly correlated Bose gas, and of the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations in the quantum critical regime.},

abstract = {We observe interaction-induced broadening of the two-photon 5s−18s transition in Rb87 atoms trapped in a 3D optical lattice. The measured linewidth increases by nearly 2 orders of magnitude with increasing atomic density and excitation strength, with corresponding suppression of resonant scattering and enhancement of off-resonant scattering. We attribute the increased linewidth to resonant dipole-dipole interactions of 18s atoms with blackbody induced population in nearby np states. Over a range of initial atomic densities and excitation strengths, the transition width is described by a single function of the steady-state density of Rydberg atoms, and the observed resonant excitation rate corresponds to that of a two-level system with the measured, rather than natural, linewidth. The broadening mechanism observed here is likely to have negative implications for many proposals with coherently interacting Rydberg atoms.},

Within the Landau Fermi liquid theory, stability criteria against Fermi liquid (Pomeranchuk) instabilities in the spin channel are considered. Focusing on the SU( n {\textgreater}2) generalizations of ferromagnetism, it is shown within mean-field theory that the transition from the paramagnet to the itinerant ferromagnet is generically first order. On symmetry grounds, general SU( n ) itinerant ferromagnetic ground states and their topological excitations are also discussed. These SU( n {\textgreater}2) ferromagnets can become stable by increasing the scattering length using optical methods or in an optical lattice. However, in an optical lattice at current experimental temperatures, Mott states with different filling are expected to coexist in the same trap, as obtained from a calculation based on the SU(6) Hubbard model.},

abstract = {The Hubbard model, containing only the minimum ingredients of nearest neighbor hopping and on-site interaction for correlated electrons, has succeeded in accounting for diverse phenomena observed in solid-state materials. One of the interesting extensions is to enlarge its spin symmetry to SU(N{\textgreater}2), which is closely related to systems with orbital degeneracy. Here we report a successful formation of the SU(6) symmetric Mott insulator state with an atomic Fermi gas of ytterbium (173Yb) in a three-dimensional optical lattice. Besides the suppression of compressibility and the existence of charge excitation gap which characterize a Mott insulating phase, we reveal an important difference between the cases of SU(6) and SU(2) in the achievable temperature as the consequence of different entropy carried by an isolated spin. This is analogous to Pomeranchuk cooling in solid 3He and will be helpful for investigating exotic quantum phases of SU(N) Hubbard system at extremely low temperatures.},

Because of the large dipolar coupling between two Rydberg atoms, a small admixture of Rydberg character into a ground state can produce an atom with a dipole moment of a few Debye, the appropriate size to observe interesting dipolar physics effects in cold atom systems. We have calculated the interaction energies for atoms that interact via the dipole-dipole interaction and find that due to blockade effects, the R-dependent two-atom interaction terms are limited in size, and can be R-independent up until the dipolar energy is equal to the detuning. This produces R-dependent interactions different from the expected 1/R{\^{}}3 dipolar form, which have no direct analogy in condensed matter physics, and could lead to new quantum phases in trapped Rydberg systems.},

While initially suppressed in the trap, density fluctuations emerge gradually during expansion as a result of initial phase fluctuations present in the trapped quasicondensate. Asymptotically, they are governed by the thermal coherence length of the system. Our measurements take place in an intermediate regime where density correlations are related to near-field diffraction effects and anomalous correlations play an important role. Comparison with a recent theoretical approach described by Imambekov et al. yields good agreement with our experimental results and shows that density correlations can be used for thermometry of quasicondensates.},

abstract = {Throughout physics, stable composite objects are usually formed via attractive forces, which allow the constituents to lower their energy by binding together. Repulsive forces separate particles in free space. However, in a structured environment such as a periodic potential and in the absence of dissipation, stable composite objects can exist even for repulsive interactions. Here we report on the first observation of such an exotic bound state, comprised of a pair of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. Consistent with our theoretical analysis, these repulsively bound pairs exhibit long lifetimes, even under collisions with one another. Signatures of the pairs are also recognised in the characteristic momentum distribution and through spectroscopic measurements. There is no analogue in traditional condensed matter systems of such repulsively bound pairs, due to the presence of strong decay channels. These results exemplify on a new level the strong correspondence between the optical lattice physics of ultracold bosonic atoms and the Bose-Hubbard model, a correspondence which is vital for future applications of these systems to the study of strongly correlated condensed matter systems and to quantum information.},

abstract = {Interactions lie at the heart of correlated many-body quantum phases. Typically, the interactions between microscopic particles are described as two-body interactions. However, it has been shown that higher-order multi-body interactions could give rise to novel quantum phases with intriguing properties. So far, multi-body interactions have been observed as inelastic loss resonances in three- and four-body recombinations of atom-atom and atom-molecule collisions. Here we demonstrate the presence of effective multi-body interactions in a system of ultracold bosonic atoms in a three-dimensional optical lattice, emerging through virtual transitions of particles from the lowest energy band to higher energy bands. We observe such interactions up to the six-body case in time-resolved traces of quantum phase revivals, using an atom interferometric technique that allows us to precisely measure the absolute energies of atom number states at a lattice site. In addition, we show that the spectral content of these time traces can reveal the atom number statistics at a lattice site, similar to foundational experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics that yield the statistics of a cavity photon field. Our precision measurement of multi-body interaction energies provides crucial input for the comparison of optical-lattice quantum simulators with many-body quantum theory.},

abstract = {We show that strong coupling between ions in an ultracold neutral plasma is limited by electron screening. While electron screening reduces the quasiequilibrium ion temperature, it also reduces the ion-ion electrical potential energy. The net result is that the ratio of nearest-neighbor potential energy to kinetic energy in quasiequilibrium is constant and limited to approximately 1 unless the electrons are heated by some external source. We support these conclusions by reporting measurements of the ion velocity distribution in an ultracold neutral calcium plasma. These results match previously reported simulations of Yukawa systems. Theoretical considerations are used to determine the screened nearest-neighbor potential energy in the plasma.},

abstract = {In Sri Lanka, over one in three women experience intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization in their lifetime, making it a serious public health concern. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as child abuse and neglect, witnessing domestic violence, parental separation, and bullying are also widespread. Studies in Western settings have shown positive associations between ACEs and IPV perpetration in adulthood, but few have examined this relationship in a non-Western context. In the present study, we examined the association of ACEs with IPV perpetration among Sri Lankan men surveyed for the UN Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific. We found statistically significant positive associations between the number of ACE categories (ACE score) and emotional, financial, physical, and sexual IPV perpetration among Sri Lankan men. We analyzed the contributions of each ACE category and found that childhood abuse was strongly associated with perpetration of IPV in adulthood, with sexual abuse associated with the greatest increase in odds of perpetration (Adjusted odds ratio 2.36; 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.69, 3.30). Witnessing abuse of one's mother was associated with the greatest increase in the odds of perpetrating physical IPV (AOR 1.82; 95{\%} CI: 1.29, 2.58), while lack of a male parental figure was not associated with physical IPV perpetration (AOR 0.76; 95{\%} CI: 0.53, 1.09). These findings support a social learning theory of IPV perpetration, in which children who are exposed to violence learn to perpetrate IPV in adulthood. They also suggest that in Sri Lanka, being raised in a female-headed household does not increase the risk of IPV perpetration in adulthood compared to being raised in a household with a male parental figure. The relationship between being raised in a female-headed household (the number of which increased dramatically during Sri Lanka's recent civil war) and perpetration of IPV warrants further study. Interventions that aim to decrease childhood abuse in Sri Lanka could both protect children now and reduce IPV in the future, decreasing violence on multiple fronts.},

abstract = {Many-body effects are at the very heart of diverse phenomena found in condensed-matter physics. One striking example is the Mott insulator phase where conductivity is suppressed as a result of a strong repulsive interaction. Advances in cold atom physics have led to the realization of the Mott insulating phases of atoms in an optical lattice, mimicking the corresponding condensed matter systems. Here, we explore an exotic strongly-correlated system of Interacting Dual Mott Insulators of bosons and fermions. We reveal that an inter-species interaction between bosons and fermions drastically modifies each Mott insulator, causing effects that include melting, generation of composite particles, an anti-correlated phase, and complete phase-separation. Comparisons between the experimental results and numerical simulations indicate intrinsic adiabatic heating and cooling for the attractively and repulsively interacting dual Mott Insulators, respectively.},

Our results for the nonrelativistic and relativistic (spin-orbit coupled) potentials deviate substantially from recent ab initio calculations.

abstract = {We report on the attainment of a spin-polarized Fermi sea of 87 Sr in thermal contact with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of 84 Sr. Interisotope collisions thermalize the fermions with the bosons during evaporative cooling. A degeneracy with T /T F = 0.30(5) is reached for a 87 Sr Fermi sea of 2 × 10 4 atoms together with an almost pure 84 Sr BEC of 10 5 atoms. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevA.82.011608 PACS number(s): 67.85.Hj, 37.10.De, 03.75.Ss Groundbreaking experiments with ultracold Fermi gases [1,2] have opened possibilities to study fascinating phenom-ena, such as the BCS-BEC crossover, with a high degree of control. Most experiments have been performed with the two alkali-metal fermions 40 K and 6 Li. Fermions with two valence electrons, such as 43 Ca, 87 Sr, 171 Yb, and 173 Yb, have a much richer internal state structure, which is at the heart of recent proposals for quantum computation and simulation [3–9]. Unlike bosonic isotopes of these elements, the fermions have a nuclear spin, which decouples from the electronic state in the 1 S 0 ground state. This gives rise to a SU(N) spin symmetry, where N is the number of nuclear spin states, which is 10 for 87 Sr. This symmetry can lead to new quantum phases in optical lattices [3–6] such as the chiral spin liquid. Non-Abelian gauge potentials can be realized by engineering state-dependent lattices [7]. In addition, the nuclear spin can be used to robustly store quantum information, which can be manipulated using the electronic structure [8,9]. Double-degenerate Bose-Fermi mixtures extend the possibilities even further, allowing the study of phase separation and the effects of mediated interactions. Evaporative cooling of ultracold atoms to quantum degen-eracy relies on elastic collisions to thermalize the sample. Identical fermions do not collide at low temperatures; therefore mixtures of spins [10–14], isotopes [15–17], or elements [18–20] are used for evaporation. 87 Sr has a large nuclear spin of I = 9/2, which leads to a 10-fold degenerate ground state. Recently, 87 Sr in a mixture of these states was cooled to quantum degeneracy [13]. In this Rapid Communication, we report on the attainment of a spin-polarized quantum degenerate Fermi gas of 87 Sr together with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of 84 Sr. Interisotope collisions are used to thermalize the fermions with the bosons. The system provides a clean starting point for the exploration of alkaline-earth Bose-Fermi mixtures. Our scheme to generate a BEC of 84 Sr is described in Ref. [21]. We have extended this scheme to the preparation of Bose-Fermi mixtures. In the following, we briefly summa-rize the basic preparation steps, while technical details will be presented elsewhere [22]. We take advantage of atoms in the metastable 5s5p 3 P 2 state that can be trapped in the quadrupole magnetic field of the magneto-optical trap (MOT). These atoms are automatically produced when operating a " blue MOT " on the 5s 2 1 S 0 -5s5p 1 P 1 transition at a wave-length of 461 nm. The 461 nm laser system is initially tuned to the 84 Sr line, and metastable-state bosons are accumulated in the magnetic trap. After 5 s, the laser frequency is shifted by 210 MHz to the 87 Sr line, and metastable-state fermions are added to the magnetic trap for another 6 s [23]. Further cooling and density increase of the mixture is achieved by operating " red MOTs " for each isotope simul-taneously on the 7.4 kHz linewidth 1 S 0 -3 P 1 intercombination lines at 689 nm. Since 87 Sr has a nuclear spin, its 3 P 1 state is split into three hyperfine states with F},

Here we discuss a variant of these schemes, in which gate operations are performed in nuclear-spin-dependent optical lattices, formed by near-resonant coupling to the metastable excited state. This provides an alternative to a previous scheme [A. J. Daley, M. M. Boyd, J. Ye, and P. Zoller, Phys. Rev. Lett 101, 170504 (2008)], which involved independent lattices for different electronic states. As in the previous case, we show how existing ideas for quantum computing with Alkali atoms such as entanglement via controlled collisions can be freed from important technical restrictions. We also provide additional details on the use of collisional losses from metastable states to perform gate operations via a lossy blockade mechanism.},

abstract = {The laser-excitation of Rydberg atoms in ultracold gases is often described assuming that the atomic motion is frozen during the excitation time. We show that this frozen gas approximation can break down for atoms that are held in optical lattices or microtraps. In particular, we show that the excitation dynamics is in general strongly affected by mechanical forces among the Rydberg atoms as well as the spread of the atomic wavepacket in the confining potential. This causes decoherence in the excitation dynamics - resulting in a dissipative blockade effect - that renders the Rydberg excitation inefficient even in the anti-blockade regime. For a strongly off-resonant laser excitation - usually considered in the context of Rydberg dressing - these motional effects compromise the applicability of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. This affects the concept of effective potentials commonly used for describing the interaction between Rydberg dressed atoms.},

abstract = {We propose a new all-optical method to image individual atoms within dense atomic gases. The scheme exploits interaction induced shifts on highly polarizable excited states, which can be spatially resolved via an electromagnetically induced transparency resonance. We focus in particular on imaging strongly interacting many-body states of Rydberg atoms embedded in an ultracold gas of ground state atoms. Using a realistic model we show that it is possible to image individual impurity atoms with enhanced sensitivity and high resolution despite photon shot noise and atomic density fluctuations. This new imaging scheme is ideally suited to equilibrium and dynamical studies of complex many-body phenomena involving strongly interacting atoms. As an example we study blockade effects and correlations in the distribution of Rydberg atoms optically excited from a dense gas.},

abstract = {Noise in a quantum system is fundamentally governed by the statistics and the many-body state of the underlying particles. The correlated noise observed for bosonic particles (for example, photons or bosonic neutral atoms) can be explained within a classical field description with fluctuating phases; however, the anticorrelations ('antibunching') observed in the detection of fermionic particles have no classical analogue. Observations of such fermionic antibunching are scarce and have been confined to electrons and neutrons. Here we report the direct observation of antibunching of neutral fermionic atoms. By analysing the atomic shot noise in a set of standard absorption images of a gas of fermionic (40)K atoms released from an optical lattice, we find reduced correlations for distances related to the original spacing of the trapped atoms. The detection of such quantum statistical correlations has allowed us to characterize the ordering and temperature of the Fermi gas in the lattice. Moreover, our findings are an important step towards revealing fundamental fermionic many-body quantum phases in periodic potentials, which are at the focus of current research.},

The pseudo spin is realized by optically exciting 87 Rb atoms to a Rydberg state. Hence, the upper spin states are coupled via the strong van der Waals interaction. Two different experimental techniques to measure the dephasing rates are shown: the 'rotary echo' technique known from nuclear magnetic resonance physics and electromagnetically induced transparency. The experiments are performed in a dense frozen Rydberg gas, either confined in a magnetic trap or in an optical dipole trap. Additionally, a numerical simulation is used to analyse the dephasing in the rotary echo experiments.},

abstract = {Fermionic alkaline-earth atoms have unique properties that make them attractive candidates for the realization of novel atomic clocks and degenerate quantum gases. At the same time, they are attracting considerable theoretical attention in the context of quantum information processing. Here we demonstrate that when such atoms are loaded in optical lattices, they can be used as quantum simulators of unique many-body phenomena. In particular, we show that the decoupling of the nuclear spin from the electronic angular momentum can be used to implement many-body systems with an unprecedented degree of symmetry, characterized by the SU(N) group with N as large as 10. Moreover, the interplay of the nuclear spin with the electronic degree of freedom provided by a stable optically excited state allows for the study of spin-orbital physics. Such systems may provide valuable insights into strongly correlated physics of transition metal oxides, heavy fermion materials, and spin liquid phases.},

A change of the rotational assignment by four units compared to an earlier work (G. Gerber, R. M$\backslash$"oller, and H. Schneider, J. Chem. Phys. 81, 1538 (1984)) is needed for a consistent description leading to a significant shift of the potentials towards longer inter atomic distances. The huge amount of ground state data derived for the three different isotopomers 88Sr2, 86Sr88Sr and 87Sr88Sr (almost 60{\%} of all excisting bound rovibrational ground state levels for the isotopomer 88Sr2) fixes this assignment undoubtedly. The presented ground state potential is derived from the observed transitions for the radial region from 4 to 11 A (9 cm-1 below the asymptote) and is extended to the longe range region by the use of theoretical dispersion coefficients together with already available photoassociation data. New estimations of the scattering lengths for the complete set of isotopic combinations are derived by mass scaling with the derived potential. The data set for the excited state 2{\_}1Sigma+u was sufficient to derive a potential energy curve around the minimum.},

abstract = {Particles with short-range interactions and a large scattering length have universal low-energy properties that do not depend on the details of their structure or their interactions at short distances. In the 2-body sector, the universal properties are familiar and depend only on the scattering length a. In the 3-body sector for identical bosons, the universal properties include the existence of a sequence of shallow 3-body bound states called "Efimov states" and log-periodic dependence of scattering observables on the energy and the scattering length. The spectrum of Efimov states in the limit a → ± ∞ is characterized by an asymptotic discrete scaling symmetry that is the signature of renormalization group flow to a limit cycle. In this review, we present a thorough treatment of universality for the system of three identical bosons and we summarize the universal information that is currently available for other 3-body systems. Our basic tools are the hyperspherical formalism to provide qualitative insights, Efimov's radial laws for deriving the constraints from unitarity, and effective field theory for quantitative calculations. We also discuss topics on the frontiers of universality, including its extension to systems with four or more particles and the systematic calculation of deviations from universality. {\textcopyright}2006.},

This leads to significant enhancement of the electron energy gain and the inverse bremsstrahlung heating rate in strong laser fields. Nonlinear processes such as Coulomb focusing and correlated collisions of electrons being brought back to the same ion by the oscillatory field are responsible for large angle, head-on scattering processes. The statistical importance of these trajectories has been examined for mono-energetic beam-like, Maxwellian and highly anisotropic electron distribution functions.

abstract = {Dirac points are central to many phenomena in condensed-matter physics, from massless electrons in graphene to the emergence of conducting edge states in topological insulators. At a Dirac point, two energy bands intersect linearly and the electrons behave as relativistic Dirac fermions. In solids, the rigid structure of the material determines the mass and velocity of the electrons, as well as their interactions. A different, highly flexible means of studying condensed-matter phenomena is to create model systems using ultracold atoms trapped in the periodic potential of interfering laser beams. Here we report the creation of Dirac points with adjustable properties in a tunable honeycomb optical lattice. Using momentum-resolved interband transitions, we observe a minimum bandgap inside the Brillouin zone at the positions of the two Dirac points. We exploit the unique tunability of our lattice potential to adjust the effective mass of the Dirac fermions by breaking inversion symmetry. Moreover, changing the lattice anisotropy allows us to change the positions of the Dirac points inside the Brillouin zone. When the anisotropy exceeds a critical limit, the two Dirac points merge and annihilate each other-a situation that has recently attracted considerable theoretical interest but that is extremely challenging to observe in solids. We map out this topological transition in lattice parameter space and find excellent agreement with ab initio calculations. Our results not only pave the way to model materials in which the topology of the band structure is crucial, but also provide an avenue to exploring many-body phases resulting from the interplay of complex lattice geometries with interactions.},

abstract = {This review covers our current understanding of strongly coupled Quark–Gluon Plasma (sQGP), especially theoretical progress in: (i) explaining the RHIC data by hydrodynamics; (ii) describing lattice data using electric–magnetic duality; (iii) understanding of gauge-string duality known as AdS/CFT and its application for “conformal” plasma. In view of the interdisciplinary nature of the subject, we include a brief introduction into several topics “for pedestrians”. Some fundamental questions addressed are: Why is sQGP such a good liquid? What is the nature of (de)confinement and what do we know about “magnetic” objects creating it? Do they play any important role in sQGP physics? Can we understand the AdS/CFT predictions, from the gauge theory side? Can they be tested experimentally? Can AdS/CFT duality help us understand rapid equilibration/entropy production? Can we work out a complete dynamical “gravity dual” to heavy ion collisions?},

abstract = {Rydberg atoms have an electron in a state with a very high principal quantum number, and as a result can exhibit unusually long-range interactions. One example is the bonding of two such atoms by multipole forces to form Rydberg-Rydberg molecules with very large internuclear distances. Notably, bonding interactions can also arise from the low-energy scattering of a Rydberg electron with negative scattering length from a ground-state atom. In this case, the scattering-induced attractive interaction binds the ground-state atom to the Rydberg atom at a well-localized position within the Rydberg electron wavefunction and thereby yields giant molecules that can have internuclear separations of several thousand Bohr radii. Here we report the spectroscopic characterization of such exotic molecular states formed by rubidium Rydberg atoms that are in the spherically symmetric s state and have principal quantum numbers, n, between 34 and 40. We find that the spectra of the vibrational ground state and of the first excited state of the Rydberg molecule, the rubidium dimer Rb(5s)-Rb(ns), agree well with simple model predictions. The data allow us to extract the s-wave scattering length for scattering between the Rydberg electron and the ground-state atom, Rb(5s), in the low-energy regime (kinetic energy, {\textless}100 meV), and to determine the lifetimes and the polarizabilities of the Rydberg molecules. Given our successful characterization of s-wave bound Rydberg states, we anticipate that p-wave bound states, trimer states and bound states involving a Rydberg electron with large angular momentum-so-called trilobite molecules-will also be realized and directly probed in the near future.},

In this paper, we use Monte Carlo simulations and semianalytic models to study theoretically the experimental parameter regimes in which evaporative cooling is feasible under current trapping conditions. We investigate the effect of the anisotropic character of dipole-dipole collisions and reduced dimensionality on evaporative cooling. We also present an analysis of the experimentally relevant anti-evaporation effects that are induced by chemical reactions that take place when more than one axial vibrational state is populated.},

abstract = {Clusters of atoms or molecules have been extensively studied by a variety of spectros-copies because of their unusual properties. Experiments with van der Waals clusters of defined sizes are not easily possible because nozzle beam expansions used in their production yield broad size distributions. Moreover, being weakly bound they readily fragment in the commonly used electron impact-ionization mass spectrometer detectors. Here it is shown that light fragile clusters of He, H2, and D2 can be selected and identified nondestructively by diffraction from a transmission grating. The method is universally applicable also to heavier species and well suited for spectroscopic studies. The experimental and theoretical study of clusters of atoms and molecules has become an important emerging area of chemical physics. Intermediate in size between indi-vidual atoms and molecules and bulk mat-ter, clusters provide insight into how the properties of bulk matter evolve from those of their atomic constituents (1). In nozzle beam expansions, a large variety of small, weakly bound clusters of different composi-tion can be formed. From their spectroscop-ic investigation, which is being actively pursued in many laboratories, one hopes to gain insight into the extent to which, for example, pairwise additive forces can ex-plain the intramolecular interactions and when nonpairwise forces come into play. At present, it is usually not possible either to select or to detect and identify quantitative-ly small van der Waals clusters. Detection by mass spectrometry suffers from the indis-tinguishability of the signals at small masses and of those signals resulting from the frag-mentation of larger clusters (2). Moreover, small clusters dissociatively ionize to an un-known extent and for very weakly bound species may dissociate almost entirely so that they become difficult to detect. For selecting and characterizing clusters of dif-ferent sizes, several different deflection scat-tering techniques have been developed, but these are restricted either to large clusters (N 500) (3-6) or to small, tightly bound clusters (N ' 10) (7, 8). To circumvent these problems, we de-veloped a technique in which molecular beams containing clusters produced in a conventional nozzle beam expansion are diffracted from a transmission grating. The use of similar gratings for diffracting atomic beams has been demonstrated recently (9, 10), but the resolution in these pioneering experiments was much less than that re-ported here.

abstract = {The coupling of electrons to matter lies at the heart of our understanding of material properties such as electrical conductivity. Electron-phonon coupling can lead to the formation of a Cooper pair out of two repelling electrons, which forms the basis for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductivity. Here we study the interaction of a single localized electron with a Bose-Einstein condensate and show that the electron can excite phonons and eventually trigger a collective oscillation of the whole condensate. We find that the coupling is surprisingly strong compared to that of ionic impurities, owing to the more favourable mass ratio. The electron is held in place by a single charged ionic core, forming a Rydberg bound state. This Rydberg electron is described by a wavefunction extending to a size of up to eight micrometres, comparable to the dimensions of the condensate. In such a state, corresponding to a principal quantum number of n = 202, the Rydberg electron is interacting with several tens of thousands of condensed atoms contained within its orbit. We observe surprisingly long lifetimes and finite size effects caused by the electron exploring the outer regions of the condensate. We anticipate future experiments on electron orbital imaging, the investigation of phonon-mediated coupling of single electrons, and applications in quantum optics.},

Using artificial gauge fields induced by laser-assisted tunneling, we realize arrays of decoupled ladder systems that are exposed to a uniform magnetic field. By suddenly decoupling the ladders and projecting into isolated double wells, we are able to measure the currents on each side of the ladder. For large coupling strengths along the rungs of the ladder, we find a saturated maximum chiral current corresponding to a full screening of the artificial magnetic field. For lower coupling strengths, the chiral current decreases in good agreement with expectations of a vortex lattice phase. Our work marks the first realization of a low-dimensional Meissner effect and, furthermore, it opens the path to exploring interacting particles in low dimensions exposed to a uniform magnetic field.},

abstract = {This note primarily describes the mathematics of least squares regression analysis as it is often used in geodesy including land surveying and satellite positioning applications. In these fields regression is often termed adjustment. The note also contains a couple of typical land surveying and satellite positioning application examples. In these application areas we are typically interested in the parameters in the model typically 2- or 3-D positions and not in predictive modelling which is often the main concern in other regression analysis applications. Adjustment is often used to obtain estimates of relevant parameters in an over-determined system of equations which may arise from deliberately carrying out more measurements than actually needed to determine the set of desired parameters. An example may be the determination of a geographical position based on information from a number of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites also known as space vehicles (SV). It takes at least four SVs to determine the position (and the clock error) of a GNSS receiver. Often more than four SVs are used and we use adjustment to obtain a better estimate of the geographical position (and the clock error) and to obtain estimates of the uncertainty with which the position is determined. Regression analysis is used in many other fields of application both in the natural, the technical and the social sciences. Examples may be curve fitting, calibration, establishing relationships between different variables in an experiment or in a survey, etc. Regression analysis is probably one the most used statistical techniques around. Dr. Anna B. O. Jensen provided insight and data for the Global Positioning System (GPS) example. Matlab code and sections that are considered as either traditional land surveying material or as advanced material are typeset with smaller fonts. Comments in general or on for example unavoidable typos, shortcomings and errors are most welcome.},

abstract = {Photoassociation is the process in which two colliding atoms absorb a photon to form an excited molecule. The development of laser-cooling techniques for producing gases at ultracold ($\backslash$textless1 mK) temperatures allows photoassociation spectroscopy to be performed with very high spectral resolution. Of particular interest is the investigation of molecular states whose properties can be related, with high precision, to the properties of their constituent atoms with the “complications” of chemical binding accounted for by a few parameters. These include bound long-range or purely long-range vibrational states in which two atoms spend most or all of their time at large internuclear separations. Low-energy atomic scattering states also share this characteristic. Photoassociation techniques have made important contributions to the study of all of these. This review describes what is special about photoassociation spectroscopy at ultracold temperatures, how it is performed, and a sampling of results including the determination of scattering lengths, their control via optical Feshbach resonances, precision determinations of atomic lifetimes from molecular spectra, limits on photoassociation rates in a Bose-Einstein condensate, and briefly, production of cold molecules. Discussions are illustrated with examples on alkali-metal atoms as well as other species. Progress in the field is already past the point where this review can be exhaustive, but an introduction is provided on the capabilities of photoassociation spectroscopy and the techniques presently in use.},

abstract = {We calculate the dynamics of the one and two body correlation functions in a homogeneous Bose gas at zero temperature following a sudden change in the interaction strength, with and without an underlying lattice. We focus on conceptually simple examples that highlight the features arising separately from interactions and band structure. In the continuum, we show that the Bogoliubov spectrum leads to a diffusive evolution of density correlations for short times, and ballistic at long times. In the lattice we find that the correlation functions develop additional oscillations. Moreover, the lattice dispersion induces an additional velocity scale, and some features instead propagate with that velocity. Finally, we discuss the time-evolution of the contact following a quench. Our predictions, which can be readily tested in experiments, serve as a benchmark for considering the dynamics of more complicated systems.},

An expression for the corresponding polaronic coupling strength is derived, relating the coupling strength to the scattering lengths, the trap size and the number of Bose condensed atoms. This allows to identify several approaches to reach the strong-coupling limit for the quantum gas po-larons, whereas this limit was hitherto experimentally inaccessible in solids. We apply Feynman's path-integral method to calculate for all coupling strengths the polaronic shift in the free energy and the increase in the effective mass. The effect of temperature on these quantities is included in the description. We find similarities to the acoustic polaron results and indications of a transition between free polarons and self-trapped polarons. The prospects, based on the current theory, of investigating the polaron physics with ultracold gases are discussed for lithium atoms in a sodium condensate.},

abstract = {Quantum optical techniques may yield immersion fluids with high indices of refraction without absorption. We describe one such technique in which a probe field experiences a large index of refraction with amplification rather than absorption, and examine its practicality for an immersion lithography application. Enhanced index can be observed in a three-level system with a tunable, near-resonant, coherent probe and incoherent pump field that inverts population of the probe transition. This observation contradicts the common belief that large indices of refraction are impossible without absorption, however it is well in accord with existing electromagnetic theory and practice. Calculations show that a refractive index {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 2 is possible with practical experimental parameters. A scheme with an incoherent mixture of pumped and unpumped atoms is also examined, and is seen to have a lower refractive index ({\~{}}2) accompanied by neither gain nor loss.},

abstract = {Open questions abound regarding how the interplay between disorder and inter-particle interactions affects essential properties of electronic solids. For example, a complete understanding of how competing phases and disorder conspire to create inhomogeneity in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates and the role of disorder in materials that exhibit colossal magnetoresistance, such as the manganites, has been elusive despite decades of active research. Fundamental transport issues, such as whether interactions enhance or inhibit localization of metallic phases, also remain unresolved. Here we use ultracold atoms trapped in a disordered optical lattice to realize a minimal model for strongly correlated, disordered electronic solids---the disordered Fermi Hubbard model (DFHM)---and to probe the impact of disorder on the metallic and Mott insulator (MI) phases. We measure a disorder-driven metal--insulator transition, and we observe that interactions raise the critical disorder energy, thereby stabilizing the metallic phase. Introducing disorder in the MI regime creates density fluctuations that are consistent with disruption of the Hubbard gap. Because we utilize fully known and controllable disorder, our work supports new and more stringent tests of theoretical and numerical approaches to understanding the influence of disorder on strongly correlated systems. If lower temperatures can be reached in optical lattices, our methods may enable measurements of the effect of disorder on the analogue of high-temperature superconductivity.},

By controlling the relative size of the power broadened transition linewidth and the single-photon recoil frequency shift, we show that it is possible to continuously bridge the gap between semiclassical and quantum mechanical cooling. Novel semiclassical cooling process, some of which are intimately linked to gravity, are also explored. Moreover, for laser frequencies tuned above the atomic resonance, we demonstrate momentum-space crystals containing up to 26 well defined lattice points. Gravitationally assisted cooling is also achieved with blue-detuned light. Theoretically, we find the blue detuned dynamics are universal to Doppler limited systems. This paper offers the most comprehensive study of narrow line laser cooling to date.},

@article{hha76,
abstract = {The dissipation induced by coulomb-collisional scattering provides an irreducible minimum, and thus a useful standard for comparison, for transport processes in a hot, magnetically confined plasma. The kinetic description of this dissipation is provided by an equation of the Fokker-Planck form. As in the standard transport theory for a neutral gas, approximate solution of the Fokker-Planck equation permits the calculation of transport coefficients, which linearly relate the fluxes of particles, energy, and electric charge, to the density and temperature gradients, and to the electric field. The transport relations are useful in studying the confinement properties of present and future experimental devices for research in controlled thermonuclear fusion. The transport theory for a magnetized plasma (in which the Larmor radius is much smaller than gradient scale lengths describing the plasma fluid) departs from the theory for a neutral gas in several fundamental ways. Thus, transport coefficients for a magnetized plasma can be calculated even when the collisional mean free path is much longer than the gradient scale length (as would pertain in thermonuclear regimes). Such transport coefficients are generally nonlocal, being defined in terms of averages over surfaces with macroscopic dimensions. Furthermore, when the mean free path is long, the magnetized-plasma transport coefficients depend crucially upon the magnetic field geometry, the effects of which must be treated at the kinetic level of the Fokker-Planck equation. The results display several novel couplings between collisional dissipation and the electromagnetic field. The present review of magnetized-plasma transport theory is intended to be as widely accessible as possible. Thus the relevant features of magnetic confinement in closed (toroidal) systems, and of charged particles in spatially varying fields, are derived, at least in outline, from first principles. Although consideration is given to "classical" transport in which most field geometric effects are omitted, major emphasis is placed on the "neoclassical" theory which has been developed over the last decade. Neoclassical transport coefficients are specifically relevant to a magnetically confined plasma, rather than to just a magnetized plasma; their unusual features, such as nonlocality and geometry dependence, become particularly important in the high temperature regime of proposed thermonuclear reactors. The area of neoclassical theory which seems most complete—its application to axisymmetric tokamak-type confinement systems—is correspondingly stressed.},

The measurements demonstrate that a rapid decrease in the ground-state atom population in the ODT occurs even for weak dressing and when well detuned from resonance. This decrease is attributed to Rydberg atom excitation, which can lead to direct escape from the trap and to population of very long-lived 5s5p 3 P 0,2 metastable states. The effects of interactions between Rydberg atoms, including those populated by blackbody radiation, are analyzed. The work has important implications when considering the use of Rydberg dressing to control the interactions between dressed ground-state atoms.},

abstract = {Following Feynman and as elaborated on by Lloyd, a universal quantum simulator (QS) is a controlled quantum device which reproduces the dynamics of any other many particle quantum system with short range interactions. This dynamics can refer to both coherent Hamiltonian and dissipative open system evolution. We investigate how laser excited Rydberg atoms in large spacing optical or magnetic lattices can provide an efficient implementation of a universal QS for spin models involving (high order) n-body interactions. This includes the simulation of Hamiltonians of exotic spin models involving n-particle constraints such as the Kitaev toric code, color code, and lattice gauge theories with spin liquid phases. In addition, it provides the ingredients for dissipative preparation of entangled states based on engineering n-particle reservoir couplings. The key basic building blocks of our architecture are efficient and high-fidelity n-qubit entangling gates via auxiliary Rydberg atoms, including a possible dissipative time step via optical pumping. This allows to mimic the time evolution of the system by a sequence of fast, parallel and high-fidelity n-particle coherent and dissipative Rydberg gates.},

abstract = {Magnetic fields play an important role in shaping the structure and evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, but the details of this relationship remain unclear. With SKA1, the 3D structure of galactic magnetic fields and its connection to star formation will be revealed. A highly sensitive probe of the internal structure of the magnetoionized ISM is the partial depolarization of synchrotron radiation from inside the volume. Different configurations of magnetic field and ionized gas within the resolution element of the telescope lead to frequency-dependent changes in the observed degree of polarization. The results of spectro-polarimetric observations are tied to physical structure in the ISM through comparison with detailed modeling, supplemented with the use of new analysis techniques that are being actively developed and studied within the community such as Rotation Measure Synthesis. The SKA will enable this field to come into its own and begin the study of the detailed structure of the magnetized ISM in a sample of nearby galaxies, thanks to its extraordinary wideband capabilities coupled with the combination of excellent surface brightness sensitivity and angular resolution.},

abstract = {How does a chemical reaction proceed at ultralow temperatures? Can simple quantum mechanical rules such as quantum statistics, single partial-wave scattering, and quantum threshold laws provide a clear understanding of the molecular reactivity under a vanishing collision energy? Starting with an optically trapped near-quantum-degenerate gas of polar 40K87Rb molecules prepared in their absolute ground state, we report experimental evidence for exothermic atom-exchange chemical reactions. When these fermionic molecules were prepared in a single quantum state at a temperature of a few hundred nanokelvin, we observed p-wave-dominated quantum threshold collisions arising from tunneling through an angular momentum barrier followed by a short-range chemical reaction with a probability near unity. When these molecules were prepared in two different internal states or when molecules and atoms were brought together, the reaction rates were enhanced by a factor of 10 to 100 as a result of s-wave scattering, which does not have a centrifugal barrier. The measured rates agree with predicted universal loss rates related to the two-body van der Waals length.},

abstract = {Controlling strongly interacting many-body systems enables the creation of tailored quantum matter, with properties transcending those based solely on single particle physics. Atomic ensembles which are optically driven to a Rydberg state provide many examples of this, such as atom-atom entanglement, many-body Rabi oscillations, strong photon-photon interaction and spatial pair correlations. In its most basic form, Rydberg quantum matter consists of an isolated ensemble of strongly interacting atoms spatially confined to the blockade volume - a so-called superatom. Here we demonstrate the controlled creation and characterization of an isolated mesoscopic superatom by means of accurate density engineering and excitation to Rydberg {\$}p{\$}-states. Its variable size allows to investigate the transition from effective two-level physics for strong confinement to many-body phenomena in extended systems. By monitoring continuous laser-induced ionization we observe a strongly anti-bunched ion emission under blockade conditions and extremely bunched ion emission under off-resonant excitation. Our experimental setup enables in vivo measurements of the superatom, yielding insight into both excitation statistics and dynamics. We anticipate straightforward applications in quantum optics and quantum information as well as future experiments on many-body physics.},

abstract = {A quantum gas of ultracold polar molecules, with long-range and anisotropic interactions, not only would enable explorations of a large class of many-body physics phenomena but also could be used for quantum information processing. We report on the creation of an ultracold dense gas of potassium-rubidium (40K87Rb) polar molecules. Using a single step of STIRAP (stimulated Raman adiabatic passage) with two-frequency laser irradiation, we coherently transfer extremely weakly bound KRb molecules to the rovibrational ground state of either the triplet or the singlet electronic ground molecular potential. The polar molecular gas has a peak density of 10(12) per cubic centimeter and an expansion-determined translational temperature of 350 nanokelvin. The polar molecules have a permanent electric dipole moment, which we measure with Stark spectroscopy to be 0.052(2) Debye (1 Debye = 3.336 x 10(-30) coulomb-meters) for the triplet rovibrational ground state and 0.566(17) Debye for the singlet rovibrational ground state.},

abstract = {The dynamics of coherent Rabi oscillations in coupled atomic and molecular Bose-Einstein condensates is considered taking into account the atom-atom, atom-molecule, and molecule-molecule elastic interactions. The exact solution for the molecule formation probability is derived in terms of the elliptic functions. The two-dimensional space of the involved parameters intensity and detuning is analyzed and divided into two regions where the Rabi oscillations show different characteristics. A resonance curve is found, on which the molecular formation probability monotonically increases as a function of time. The maximum value of the final transition probability on this curve is 1∕2 (i.e., total transition to the molecular state) and it is achieved at high field intensities starting from a minimal threshold defined by the interspecies interaction scattering lights. The explicit form of the resonance curve is determined, and it is shown that the resonance frequency position reveals a nonlinear dependence on the Rabi frequency of the applied field. A singular point is found on the resonance curve, where a power-law time evolution of the system is observed.},

The chapter illustrates this discussion by frequency locking an extended-cavity diode laser, reducing the linewidth to a few hertz relative to the cavity. The chapter concludes with an example in which the locking apparatus is modified for a cavity ring-down demonstration. Included are results showing the laser repetitively locking and unlocking to the cavity.},

This three-body effect was originally proposed to explain the binding of nuclei such as the triton and the Hoyle state of carbon-12, and later considered as a simple explanation for the existence of some halo nuclei. It was subsequently evidenced in trapped ultra-cold atomic clouds and in diffracted molecular beams of gaseous helium. These experiments revealed that the previously undetermined three-body parameter introduced in the Efimov theory to stabilise the three-body attraction typically scales with the range of atomic interactions. The few- and many-body consequences of the Efimov attraction have been since investigated theoretically, and are expected to be observed in a broader spectrum of physical systems.},

In this Letter an analytical model is proposed for an expanding plasma cloud in an external dipole or homogeneous magnetic field. The model is based on the self-similar solution of a similar problem which deals with sudden expansion of spherical plasma into a vacuum without ambient magnetic field. The expansion characteristics of the plasma and deceleration caused by the magnetic field are examined analytically. The results obtained can be used in treating experimental and simulation data, and many phenomena of astrophysical and laboratory significance.},

abstract = {Molecular cooling techniques face the hurdle of dissipating translational as well as internal energy in the presence of a rich electronic, vibrational, and rotational energy spectrum. In our experiment, we create a translationally ultracold, dense quantum gas of molecules bound by more than 1000 wave numbers in the electronic ground state. Specifically, we stimulate with 80{\%} efficiency, a two-photon transfer of molecules associated on a Feshbach resonance from a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms. In the process, the initial loose, long-range electrostatic bond of the Feshbach molecule is coherently transformed into a tight chemical bond. We demonstrate coherence of the transfer in a Ramsey-type experiment and show that the molecular sample is not heated during the transfer. Our results show that the preparation of a quantum gas of molecules in specific rovibrational states is possible and that the creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of molecules in their rovibronic ground state is within reach.},

abstract = {With the recent production of polar molecules in the quantum regime, long-range dipolar interactions are expected to facilitate the understanding of strongly interacting many-body quantum systems and to realize lattice spin models for exploring quantum magnetism. In atomic systems, where interactions require wave function overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be realized via superexchange; however, the coupling is weak and limited to nearest-neighbor interactions. In contrast, dipolar interactions exist in the absence of tunneling and extend beyond nearest neighbors. This allows coherent spin dynamics to persist even at high entropy and low lattice filling. Effects of dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have so far been limited to the modification of chemical reactions. We now report the observation of dipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a 3D optical lattice. We realize a lattice spin model with spin encoded in rotational states, prepared and probed by microwaves. This spin-exchange interaction arises from the resonant exchange of rotational angular momentum between two molecules. We observe clear oscillations in the evolution of the spin coherence in addition to an overall decay. The frequency of these oscillations, the strong dependence of the spin coherence time on the lattice filling, and the effect of a multi-pulse sequence designed to reverse dynamics due to two-body exchange interactions all provide evidence of dipolar interactions. We also demonstrate suppression of loss in weak lattices due to a quantum Zeno mechanism. Measurements of these tunneling-induced losses allow us to independently determine the lattice filling factor. These results comprise an initial exploration of the behavior of many-body spin models with direct, long-range spin interactions and lay the groundwork for future studies of many-body dynamics in spin lattices.},

We demonstrate the existence of molecular states with equilibrium distances of the order of experimentally attainable inter-well spacings and binding energies of the order of 10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}3 GHz. We also consider the situation whereby ground-state atoms trapped in an optical lattice are collectively excited to Rydberg levels, such that the charge-density distributions of neighbouring atoms overlap.

Such systems have tunable interaction parameters and a temperature {\{}{\~{}}{\}}10{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}-4{\{}{\}}{\}} times smaller than the Fermi temperature, making them potentially attractive for the study and simulation of strongly correlated electronic systems.},

abstract = {The dynamics of a cloud of ultra-cold two-level atoms is studied at off-resonant laser driving to a Rydberg state. We find that resonant excitation channels lead to strongly peaked spatial correlations associated with the buildup of asymmetric excitation structures. These aggregates can extend over the entire ensemble volume, but are in general not localized relative to the system boundaries. The characteristic distances between neighboring excitations depend on the laser detuning and on the interaction potential. These properties lead to characteristic features in the spatial excitation density, the Mandel {\$}Q{\$} parameter, and the total number of excitations. As an application an implementation of the three-atom CSWAP or Fredkin gate with Rydberg atoms is discussed. The gate not only exploits the Rydberg blockade, but also utilizes the special features of an asymmetric geometric arrangement of the three atoms. We show that continuous-wave off-resonant laser driving is sufficient to create the required spatial arrangement of atoms out of a homogeneous cloud.},

We consider a two-photon transition scheme and study the non-linear response to a weak optical probe in presence of a strong control beam. For very low probe fields, the dominant nonlinearities are of the third order and they can be exactly evaluated in a steady state regime. In a more general case, the change in average atomic populations and coherences due to Rydberg interactions can be characterized by properly defined scaling parameters, which are generally complex numbers but in certain situations take the usual meaning of the number of atoms in a blockade sphere. They can be used in a simple "universal scaling" formula to determine the dispersive optical nonlinearity of the medium. We also develop a novel technique to account for the Rydberg interaction effects, by simplifying the treatment of nonlocal interaction terms, the so-called collisional integrals. We find algebraic relations that only involve two-body correlations, which can be solved numerically. All average populations and coherences are then obtained straightforwardly.},

abstract = {We analyze the ground state properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures using a mean-field treatment of the boson-fermion interaction on a simple cubic lattice. In the deep superfluid limit of the bosonic sector and the BCS regime of the fermion sector, we derive BCS-type equations to determine the phase diagram of the system. We find a competition between a charge density wave and a superconducting phase. In the opposite limit, we study the Mott insulator to superfluid transition of the bosonic sector in the presence of a staggered density-induced alternating potential provided by the fermions, and determine the mean-field transition line. In the two-superfluid phase of the mixture we restrict to nearest-neighbor induced interactions between the fermions and consider the extended Hubbard model. We perform a mean-field analysis of the critical temperature for the formation of boson-assisted {\$}s{\$}-, extended {\$}s{\^{}}-{\$}-, {\$}d{\$}-, and {\$}p{\$}-wave pairs at fermionic half filling. We compare our results with a recent dynamical mean-field study [Anders {\$}\backslash{\$}emph{\{}et al.{\}} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\{}{\$}\backslash{\$}bf 109{\}}, 206401].},

abstract = {NGC 6791 is a well studied open cluster that it is so close to us that can be imaged down to very faint luminosities. The main-sequence turn-off age ( approximately 8 Gyr) and the age derived from the termination of the white dwarf cooling sequence ( approximately 6 Gyr) are very different. One possible explanation is that as white dwarfs cool, one of the ashes of helium burning, (22)Ne, sinks in the deep interior of these stars. At lower temperatures, white dwarfs are expected to crystallize and phase separation of the main constituents of the core of a typical white dwarf ((12)C and (16)O) is expected to occur. This sequence of events is expected to introduce long delays in the cooling times, but has not hitherto been proven. Here we report that, as theoretically anticipated, physical separation processes occur in the cores of white dwarfs, resolving the age discrepancy for NGC 6791.},

We show that in the long time limit integrability leads to significant deviations from the predictions of the grand canonical ensemble and a description within the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) is needed. For a non-interacting initial state and arbitrary final interactions, we find that the presence of infinitely many conserved charges generates a non-analytic behavior in the equilibrated density of quasimomenta. This manifests itself in a dynamically generated Friedel-like oscillation of the non-local correlation functions with interaction dependent oscillation momenta. We also exactly evaluate local correlations and the generalized chemical potentials within GGE.},

abstract = {We experimentally investigate the action of a localized dissipative potential on a macroscopic matter wave, which we implement by shining an electron beam on an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). We measure the losses induced by the dissipative potential as a function of the dissipation strength observing a paradoxical behavior when the strength of the dissipation exceeds a critical limit: for an increase of the dissipation rate the number of atoms lost from the BEC becomes lower. We repeat the experiment for different parameters of the electron beam and we compare our results with a simple theoretical model, finding excellent agreement. By monitoring the dynamics induced by the dissipative defect we identify the mechanisms which are responsible for the observed paradoxical behavior. We finally demonstrate the link between our dissipative dynamics and the measurement of the density distribution of the BEC allowing for a generalized definition of the Zeno effect. Due to the high degree of control on every parameter, our system is a promising candidate for the engineering of fully governable open quantum systems.},

abstract = {We present the most recent results from an experiment aimed at obtaining the temperature equilibration rate between ions and electrons in a strongly coupled plasma by directly measuring the temperature of each component. The plasma is formed by heating a sonic gas jet with a 10 ps laser pulse. The electrons are preferentially heated by the short pulse laser (we are aiming for T e {\~{}} 100 eV), while the ions, after undergoing very rapid (sub-ps timescale) disorder-induced heating, should only reach a temperature of 10–15 eV. This results in a strongly coupled ion plasma with a {\$}\Gamma{\$} ii {\~{}} 3–5. We plan to measure the electron and ion temperatures of the resulting plasma independently during and after heating, using collective Thomson scattering for electrons and a high-resolution x-ray spectrometer for the ions (measuring Doppler-broadened absorption lines). Theory indicates that the equilibration rate could be significantly lower than that given by the usual weakly coupled model (Landau–Spitzer) due to coupled collective modes present in the dense plasma.},

The main focus is on the phenomenon of extraordinary optical transmission in periodic hole arrays, discovered over a decade ago. It is shown that surface electromagnetic modes play a key role in the emergence of the resonant transmission. These modes are also shown to be at the root of both the enhanced transmission and beaming of light found in single apertures surrounded by periodic corrugations. This review describes both the theoretical and experimental aspects of the subject. For clarity, the physical mechanisms operating in the different structures considered are analyzed within a common theoretical framework. Several applications based on the transmission properties of subwavelength apertures are also addressed.},

abstract = {We measure the time oscillations of a freely evolving standing wave of phonons in a Bose-Einstein condensate. We present the technique of short Bragg pulses, which stimulates the standing wave. The subsequent oscillations are observed in situ. The frequency of the oscillations gives the dispersion relation, the amplitude gives the static structure factor, and the decay gives the dephasing time. The new technique gives orders of magnitude more sensitivity than Bragg spectroscopy, allowing for the observation of deviations from the local density approximation. Specifically, it is seen that the phonons undergo a transition from three dimensions to one dimension, when their wavelength becomes longer than the transverse radius of the condensate. The one-dimensional regime contains an inflection point in the dispersion relation, a decrease in the superfluid critical velocity, a minimum in the group velocity, and an increase in the lifetime of the standing wave oscillations.},

abstract = {When two quantum systems interact strongly with each other, their simultaneous excitation by the same driving pulse may be forbidden. The phenomenon is known as blockade of excitation. Recently, extensive studies have been devoted to the so-called Rydberg blockade between neutral atoms, which appears when the atoms are in highly excited electronic states, owing to the interaction induced by the accompanying large dipole moments. Rydberg blockade has been proposed as a basic tool in quantum-information processing with neutral atoms1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and can be used to deterministically generate entanglement of several atoms. Here, we demonstrate Rydberg blockade between two atoms individually trapped in optical tweezers at a distance of 4 m. Moreover, we show experimentally that collective two-atom behaviour, associated with the excitation of an entangled state between the ground and Rydberg levels, enhances the allowed single-atom excitation. These observations should be a crucial step towards the deterministic manipulation of entanglement of two or more atoms, with possible implications for quantum-information science, as well as for quantum metrology, the study of strongly correlated systems in many-body physics, and fundamental studies in quantum physics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors relate prehospital delay and in-hospital delay to the incidence of perforation of appendicitis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Quality assurance studies use perforation rate as an index of quality of care. This is based on the assumption commonly presented in retrospective reports that in-hospital delay to surgery influences the incidence of perforation. Only one limited study prospectively found that prehospital delay increased the perforation rate.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: During a 6-month period, 95 consecutive adults undergoing appendectomies at Foothills Hospital in Calgary, Alberta, were questioned as to onset and type of first symptom (i.e., epigastric discomfort, anorexia nervosa, vomiting, and abdominal pain). Time of emergency room (ER) arrival, surgery consultation, and operating room start were taken from the chart. Surgical and pathology reports were used to identify status of appendix (normal, inflamed, suppurative, gangrenous, perforated) and presence of abscess cavity. The status of appendix was related to prehospital and in-hospital delay to establish significance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There were 13 (14{\%}) normal, 67 (70{\%}) inflamed, and 15 (16{\%}) perforated appendices. Patients with perforated appendices waited 2.5 times longer before reporting to the ER, compared with patients with inflamed appendices (57 hours vs. 22 hours, p {\textless} 0.007). Once in the hospital, patients with perforated appendices were identified and treated faster than those with inflamed appendices (7 vs. 9 hours, p {\textless} 0.039). Analysis by ER physician was 3 hours whether the appendix was normal, inflamed, or perforated. Analysis by the surgeon was significantly shorter in patients with perforated appendices than patients with inflamed appendices (4 vs. 6 hours, p {\textless} 0.039).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This prospective study identifies that delay in presentation accounts for the majority of perforated appendices. Clinical evaluation is effective for identifying patients with more advanced disease. Indiscriminate appendectomy as an attempt to decrease perforation is not supported by these data. Hospital perforation rates likely reflect patient factors, illness attitude, and access to medical care.},

abstract = {We consider the interference of atoms caused by the wave nature of their motion. Coherently interfering beams of particles may be obtained by using the diffraction of atoms from separated standing waves resonant with the transition between the ground and excited states of the atoms. Interference arises with and without spatial separation of the diffracted atomic beams. A problem concerning two-quantum perturbation of the wave function of an atom in the ground state by a standing-wave field has been solved. Both amplitude and phase perturbation are taken into account. We show that in spite of the absence of coherence in the incident beam and a rapid decay of the coherence induced by the standing wave for scattered spatially overlapping beams, the interference can be observed for the conditions of an echo. We first consider the phenomenon of an echo under the quantum-mechanical action of light on the translational degrees of freedom. We show that owing to this phenomenon phase memory can be transferred through the ground state over unlimitedly large distances. Owing to the interference of the density harmonics, a periodic structure in the spatial distribution of the atomic density with a period of less than one wavelength of the light is localized at distances of the order of the distance between the fields. The harmonic amplitude is calculated for instantaneous excitation in the case in which the duration of the excitation is comparable with the backward Doppler linewidth in the beam and for scattering under Bragg conditions. In the latter case we show that the effective temperature of the atoms participating in the interference is less than one recoil energy.},

A Stern-Gerlach field is applied, in order to spatially separate the molecules from the remaining atoms. For detection, the molecules are converted back into atoms, again using the Feshbach resonance. The measured position of the molecules yields their magnetic moment. This quantity strongly depends on the magnetic field, thus revealing an avoided crossing of two bound states at a field value slightly below the Feshbach resonance. This avoided crossing is exploited to trap the molecules in one dimension.},

abstract = {Strong correlations�cooperative behavior due to many-particle interactions�are omnipresent in nature. They occur in electrolytic solutions, dense plasmas, ultracold ions and atomic gases in traps, complex (dusty) plasmas, electrons and excitons in quantum dots and the quark�gluon plasma. Correlation effects include the emergence of long-range order, of liquid-like or crystalline structures and collective dynamic properties (collective modes). The observation and experimental analysis of strong correlations are often difficult, requiring, in many cases, extreme conditions such as very low temperatures or high densities. An exception is complex plasmas where strong coupling can be easily achieved, even at room temperature. These systems feature the strongest correlations reported so far and experiments allow for an unprecedented precision and full single-particle resolution of the stationary and time-dependent many-particle behavior. The governing role of the interactions in strongly correlated systems gives rise to many universal properties observed in all of them. This makes the analysis of one particular system interesting for many others. This motivates the goal of this paper which is to give an overview on recent experimental and theoretical results in complex plasmas including liquid-like behavior, crystal formation, structural and dynamic properties. It is expected that many of these effects will be of interest also to researchers in other fields where strong correlations play a prominent role.},

abstract = {With the production of polar molecules in the quantum regime, long-range dipolar interactions are expected to facilitate understanding of strongly interacting many-body quantum systems and to realize lattice spin models for exploring quantum magnetism. In ordinary atomic systems, where contact interactions require wavefunction overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be mediated by tunnelling, through a process referred to as superexchange; however, the coupling is relatively weak and is limited to nearest-neighbour interactions. In contrast, dipolar interactions exist even in the absence of tunnelling and extend beyond nearest neighbours. This allows coherent spin dynamics to persist even for gases with relatively high entropy and low lattice filling. Measured effects of dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have been limited to the modification of inelastic collisions and chemical reactions. Here we use dipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a three-dimensional optical lattice to realize a lattice spin model. Spin is encoded in rotational states of molecules that are prepared and probed by microwaves. Resonant exchange of rotational angular momentum between two molecules realizes a spin-exchange interaction. The dipolar interactions are apparent in the evolution of the spin coherence, which shows oscillations in addition to an overall decay of the coherence. The frequency of these oscillations, the strong dependence of the spin coherence time on the lattice filling factor and the effect of a multipulse sequence designed to reverse dynamics due to two-body exchange interactions all provide evidence of dipolar interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the suppression of loss in weak lattices due to a continuous quantum Zeno mechanism. Measurements of these tunnelling-induced losses allow us to determine the lattice filling factor independently. Our work constitutes an initial exploration of the behaviour of many-body spin models with direct, long-range spin interactions and lays the groundwork for future studies of many-body dynamics in spin lattices.},

These experiments exploit the rich electronic structure of these elements, which is markedly different from the one of other species for which quantum degeneracy has been attained. Specifically, alkaline-earth-like atoms, such as strontium, feature metastable triplet states, narrow intercombination lines, and a non-magnetic, closed-shell ground state. This review covers the creation of quantum degenerate gases of strontium and the first experiments performed with this new system. It focuses on laser-cooling and evaporation schemes, which enable the creation of Bose-Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases of all strontium isotopes, and shows how they are used for the investigation of optical Feshbach resonances, the study of degenerate gases loaded into an optical lattice, as well as the coherent creation of Sr{\_}2 molecules.},

abstract = {We present an optical setup with focus-tunable lenses to dynamically control the waist and focus position of a laser beam, in which we transport a trapped ultracold cloud of 87-Rb over a distance of 28 cm. The scheme allows us to shift the focus position at constant waist, providing uniform trapping conditions over the full transport length. The fraction of atoms that are transported over the entire distance comes near to unity, while the heating of the cloud is in the range of a few microkelvin. We characterize the position stability of the focus and show that residual drift rates in focus position can be compensated for by counteracting with the tunable lenses. Beyond being a compact and robust scheme to transport ultracold atoms, the reported control of laser beams makes dynamic tailoring of trapping potentials possible. As an example, we steer the size of the atomic cloud by changing the waist size of the dipole beam.},

abstract = {Atomic polarization phenomena impinge upon a number of areas and processes in physics. The dielectric constant and refractive index of any gas are examples of macroscopic properties that are largely determined by the dipole polarizability. When it comes to microscopic phenomena, the existence of alkaline-earth anions and the recently discovered ability of positrons to bind to many atoms are predominantly due to the polarization interaction. An imperfect knowledge of atomic polarizabilities is presently looming as the largest source of uncertainty in the new generation of optical frequency standards. Accurate polarizabilities for the group I and II atoms and ions of the periodic table have recently become available by a variety of techniques. These include refined many-body perturbation theory and coupled-cluster calculations sometimes combined with precise experimental data for selected transitions, microwave spectroscopy of Rydberg atoms and ions, refractive index measurements in microwave cavities, ab initio calculations of atomic structures using explicitly correlated wave functions, interferometry with atom beams, and velocity changes of laser cooled atoms induced by an electric field. This review examines existing theoretical methods of determining atomic and ionic polarizabilities, and discusses their relevance to various applications with particular emphasis on cold-atom physics and the metrology of atomic frequency standards.},

abstract = {Coherent molecular optics is performed using two-photon Bragg scattering. Molecules were produced by sweeping an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate through a Feshbach resonance. The spectral width of the molecular Bragg resonance corresponded to an instantaneous temperature of 20 nK, indicating that atomic coherence was transferred directly to the molecules. An autocorrelating interference technique was used to observe the quadratic spatial dependence of the phase of an expanding molecular cloud. Finally, atoms initially prepared in two momentum states were observed to cross pair with one another, forming molecules in a third momentum state. This process is analogous to sum-frequency generation in optics.},

The optical coupling of the ground and excited-state potentials changes the scattering properties of an ultracold gas in much the same way as recently observed magnetically induced Feshbach resonances, but allows for some experimental conveniences associated with using lasers. The scattering properties can be varied by changing either the intensity or the detuning of a laser tuned near a photoassociation transition to a molecular state in the dimer. In principle this method allows the scattering length of any atomic species to be altered. A simple model is used to fit the dispersive resonance line shapes.},

Unlike previous calculations which infer the atom-atom interaction from the dilute-medium limit of the macroscopic, many-body van der Waals interaction, the interaction is calculated directly for the system of two atoms in a magnetodielectric medium. Two approaches are presented, the first based on the quantized electromagnetic field in a dispersive medium without absorption and the second on Green functions that allow for absorption. We show that the correct van der Waals interactions are obtained regardless of whether absorption in the host medium is explicitly taken into account.},

Such a threshold behavior was shown for example in 4He droplets, where 4He turns into a superfluid for a specific number of particles [1]. A particularly interesting question in this context is at which point a few-body theory can be substituted by a mean field model, i. e. where the discrete number of particles can be treated as a continuous quantity. Such a transition from two non-interacting fermionic particles to a Fermi sea was demonstrated recently [2]. In this letter, we study a similar crossover to a many-body regime based on ultralong-range Rydberg molecules [3] forming a model system with binary interactions.},

abstract = {Retarded dispersion forces are calculated at finite temperature in the theory of classical electrodynamics with classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation. Expressions are given at all separations for the forces between a polarizable particle and a conducting wall and between two polarizable particles where the particles are represented by electric dipole oscillators immersed in thermal radiation. Also given are the simple expressions holding in the unretarded short-distance limit, and in the asymptotic large-distance limit. At any finite nonzero temperature T, the asymptotic large-distance Van der Waals force between two polarizable particles separated by a distance R≫ℏc/KT is given by the potential U(R)=-3{\$}\alpha{\$}2KT/R6 rather than the Casimir-Polder form for zero temperature, U(R)=-(23/4{\$}\pi{\$}){\$}\alpha{\$}2ℏc/R7, where {\$}\alpha{\$} is the static polarizability of each particle. Also the R-6 form holds at high temperatures for any fixed separation. The finite-temperature analysis presented follows directly from earlier classical work at zero temperature since within the classical theory, classical zero-point radiation and classical thermal radiation are treated on the same footing. The classical calculations are easier than those of quantum-electrodynamic perturbation theory but have been shown generally to reproduce the quantum results for dipole-oscillator systems. The forces in the high-temperature limit are shown to agree with the results of classical statistical mechanics and with the use of the Rayleigh-Jeans law for the thermal radiation spectrum. The new results for polarizable particles fit nicely with earlier work by other authors on the finite-temperature corrections to the Casimir effect, the force between uncharged conducting parallel plates. It is emphasized that the force between conducting plates may be regarded as due to the classical boundary conditions at the conductors rather than to any discrete quantum aspects; the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum also leads to a force between conducting plates and this force is in agreement with the high-temperature limit of previous calculations including zero-point radiation.},

abstract = {Quantum theory predicts that Bose-Einstein condensation of a spatially homogeneous gas with attractive interactions is precluded by a conventional phase transition into either a liquid or solid. When confined to a trap, however, such a condensate can form, provided that its occupation number does not exceed a limiting value. The stability limit is determined by a balance between the self-attractive forces and a repulsion that arises from position-momentum uncertainty under conditions of spatial confinement. Near the stability limit, self-attraction can overwhelm the repulsion, causing the condensate to collapse. Growth of the condensate is therefore punctuated by intermittent collapses that are triggered by either macroscopic quantum tunnelling or thermal fluctuation. Previous observations of growth and collapse dynamics have been hampered by the stochastic nature of these mechanisms. Here we report direct observations of the growth and subsequent collapse of a 7Li condensate with attractive interactions, using phase-contrast imaging. The success of the measurement lies in our ability to reduce the stochasticity in the dynamics by controlling the initial number of condensate atoms using a two-photon transition to a diatomic molecular state.},

We explored a strongly interacting two-level system formed by the clock states in (87)Sr as a laboratory for the study of quantum many-body effects. Our collective spin measurements reveal signatures of the development of many-body correlations during the dynamical evolution. We derived a many-body Hamiltonian that describes the experimental observation of atomic spin coherence decay, density-dependent frequency shifts, severely distorted lineshapes, and correlated spin noise. These investigations open the door to further explorations of quantum many-body effects and entanglement through use of highly coherent and precisely controlled optical lattice clocks.},

The article describes the targets, the modeling that was used to design them, and the modeling done to set specifications for the laser system in the proposed National Ignition Facility. Capsules with beryllium or polystyrene ablators are enclosed in goldhohlraums. All the designs utilize a cryogenic fuel layer; it is very difficult to achieve ignition at this scale with a noncryogenic capsule. It is necessary to use multiple bands of illumination in the hohlraum to achieve sufficiently uniform x‐ray irradiation, and to use a low‐Z gas fill in the hohlraum to reduce filling of the hohlraum with gold plasma. Critical issues are hohlraumdesign and optimization, Rayleigh–Taylor instability modeling, and laser–plasma interactions.},

The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 x 10(12) per cubic centimeter and could be preserved far more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.},

abstract = {More than 40 years ago, Andreev, Lifshitz and Chester suggested the possible existence of a peculiar solid phase of matter, the microscopic constituents of which can flow superfluidly without resistance due to the formation of zero-point defects in the ground state of self-assembled crystals. Yet, a physical system where this mechanism is unambiguously established remains to be found, both experimentally and theoretically. Here we investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram of two-dimensional bosons with finite-range soft-core interactions. For low particle densities, the system is shown to feature a solid phase in which zero-point vacancies emerge spontaneously and give rise to superfluid flow of particles through the crystal. This provides the first example of defect-induced, continuous-space supersolidity consistent with the Andreev-Lifshitz-Chester scenario.},

The molecules are created in an ultracold gas held in an optical dipole trap and their numbers determined using ?eld ionization, the product electrons being detected by a microchannel plate. The measurements show that, in marked contrast to earlier measurements involving rubidium Rydberg molecules, the lifetimes of the low-lying molecular vibrational states are very similar to those of the parent Rydberg atoms. This results because the strong p-wave resonance in low-energy electronrubidium scattering, which plays an important role in determining the molecular lifetimes, is not present for strontium. The absence of this resonance o?ers advantages for experiments involving strontium Rydberg atoms as impurities in quantum gases and for testing theories of molecular formation and decay.},

threshold are investigated, while the analysis of the triplets is restricted to the bound spectra
below the Sr + 5s threshold. Near the Sr + 5s threshold, the calculated parameters are in good
agreement with those previously fitted to spectroscopic data. The main improvements with respect to
the empirical MQDT studies concern evidence of the large energy dependence of the parameters and
identification of isolated perturbers of the 1 D 2 and 1 S 0 spectra. In addition, the energy levels
and the spectral intensities are accurately reproduced and channel mixing and correlation effects in
doubly excited states are analysed in detail. A close similarity is found between the 5snp-4d np 1 P

Explicit approximate solutions are obtained for a variety of special cases, and the results of numerical computations are given for others. The effect of an rf field on the J=2→1 l-type doublet microwave absorption lines of OCS has been studied in particular both experimentally and theoretically. Each line was observed to split into two components when the frequency of the rf field was near 12.78 Mc or 38.28 Mc, which are the frequencies separating the J=1 and J=2 pairs of levels, respectively. By measuring the rf frequency, $\nu$0, at which the microwave lines are split into two equally intense components, one may determine the separation between the energy levels. The measured value of $\nu$0 depends upon the intensity of the rf field and the form of this dependence has been calculated and found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.},

The dependence of the strength of spin correlations on the specific geometry is experimentally studied by measuring the correlations along different lattice tunneling links, where a redistribution of correlations between the different lattice links is observed. By measuring the correlations in a crossover between distinct geometries, we demonstrate an effective reduction of the dimensionality for our atom numbers and temperatures. We also investigate the formation and redistribution time of spin correlations by dynamically changing the lattice geometry and studying the time-evolution of the system. Timescales ranging from a sudden quench of the lattice geometry to an adiabatic evolution are probed.},

Here, we report on the observation of nearest-neighbor magnetic correlations emerging in the many-body state of a thermalized Fermi gas in an optical lattice. The key to obtaining short-range magnetic order is a local redistribution of entropy, which allows temperatures below the exchange energy for a subset of lattice bonds. When loading a repulsively interacting gas into either dimerized or anisotropic simple cubic configurations of a tunable-geometry lattice, we observe an excess of singlets as compared with triplets consisting of two opposite spins. For the anisotropic lattice, the transverse spin correlator reveals antiferromagnetic correlations along one spatial axis. Our work facilitates addressing open problems in quantum magnetism through the use of quantum simulation.},

abstract = {We analyze the results of a recent experiment with bosonic rubidium atoms harmonically confined in a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) geometry. In this experiment a well-defined critical point was identified, which separates the high-temperature normal state characterized by a single component density distribution, and the low-temperature state characterized by a bimodal density distribution and the emergence of high-contrast interference between independent 2D clouds. We first show that this transition cannot be explained in terms of conventional Bose‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}Einstein condensation of the trapped ideal Bose gas. Using the local density approximation (LDA), we then combine the mean-field (MF) Hartree‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}Fock theory with the prediction for the Berezinskii‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}Kosterlitz‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}Thouless (BKT) transition in an infinite uniform system. If the gas is treated as a strictly 2D system, the MF predictions for the spatial density profiles significantly deviate from those of a recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) analysis. However, when the residual thermal excitation of the strongly confined degree of freedom is taken into account, excellent agreement is reached between the MF and the QMC approaches. For the interaction strength corresponding to the experiment, we predict a strong correction to the critical atom number with respect to the ideal gas theory (factor {\~{}}2). Quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is reached concerning the critical atom number if the predicted density profiles are used for temperature calibration.},

abstract = {The influence of retardation on the energy of interaction between two neutral atoms is investigated by means of quantum electrodynamics. As a preliminary step, Part I contains a discussion of the interaction between a neutral atom and a perfectly conducting plane, and it is found that the influence of retardation leads to a reduction of the interaction energy by a correction factor which decreases monotonically with increasing distance R. This factor is equal to unity for R small compared with the wave-lengths corresponding to the atomic frequencies, and is proportional to R-1 for distances large compared with these wave-lengths. In the latter case the total interaction energy is given by -3ℏc{\$}\alpha{\$}/8{\$}\pi{\$}R4, where {\$}\alpha{\$} is the static polarizability of the atom. Although the problem of the interaction of two atoms discussed in Part II is much more difficult to handle mathematically, the results are very similar. Again the influence of retardation can be described by a monotonically decreasing correction factor which is equal to unity for small distances and proportional to R-1 for large distances. In the latter case the energy of interaction is found to be -23ℏc{\$}\alpha{\$}1{\$}\alpha{\$}2/4{\$}\pi{\$}R7.},

We observe three-dimensional AL of noninteracting ultracold matter by allowing a spin-polarized atomic Fermi gas to expand into a disordered potential. A two-component density distribution emerges consisting of an expanding mobile component and a nondiffusing localized component. We extract a mobility edge that increases with the disorder strength, whereas the thermally averaged localization length is shown to decrease with disorder strength and increase with particle energy. These measurements provide a benchmark for more sophisticated theories of AL.},

We tracked all sharks except one back to the Bimini Islands and most returned to their home ranges observed before displacement. Even sharks displaced to a site closer to another island with suitable habitat for young lemon sharks returned to their home ranges at Bimini Islands. Sharks displayed a preferred compass direction (PCD) toward the east as their first swimming direction after release, suggesting an innate sense of direction. This bearing was followed shortly afterwards by a home-oriented direction. Swimming speeds prior to reaching shore were approximately twice as fast than the usual cruising speed reported for juvenile lemon sharks. The return of young (0–2 years), inexperienced sharks to their original home range indicate high site fidelity and an ability to home},

abstract = {We present a model of continuous (in time) position measurements on a quantum system using a single pseudoclassical meter. The nonselective evolution of the system is described by a master equation which is identical to that obtained from previous models. The selective evolution is described by a stochastic nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. The significance of this equation is that the stochastic term has a physical interpretaion. By carefully choosing the parameters which define the meter and the system-meter coupling, we obtain a meter pointer with well-defined position which undergoes fluctuations. This ‘‘jitter'' in the pointer position gives rise to the stochastic dynamical collapse of the system wave function. By the inclusion of feedback on the meter, the pointer is made to relax towards an appropriate readout. We apply this model to the selective measurement of the position of a particle in a double-well potential. In contrast to a recent claim [H. Fearn and W. E. Lamb, Jr., Phys. Rev. A 46, 1199 (1992)] we show that truly continuous position measurements lead to a quantum Zeno effect in certain parameter regimes. This is manifest by the changing of the particle dynamics from coherent tunneling between the well minima to incoherent flipping, as in a random telegraph. As the measurement strength increases, the average length of time the particle remains stuck in one well increases proportionally.},

The value of a¯, the average scattering length, also determines the slope of the s-wave phase shifts beyond the near-threshold region. The formula is applicable to the collisions of atoms cooled down in traps, where the scattering length determines the character of the atom-atom interaction. Our calculation shows that repulsion between atoms (a{\textgreater}0) is more likely than attraction with a ‘‘probability'' of 75{\%}. For the Cs-Cs scattering in the 3$\Sigma$u state, a¯=95.5aB has been obtained, where aB is the Bohr radius.

@article{Itano2009,
abstract = {As of October 2006, there were approximately 535 citations to the seminal 1977 paper of Misra and Sudarshan that pointed out the quantum Zeno paradox (more often called the quantum Zeno effect). In simple terms, the quantum Zeno effect refers to a slowing down of the evolution of a quantum state in the limit that the state is observed continuously. There has been much disagreement as to how the quantum Zeno effect should be defined and as to whether it is really a paradox, requiring new physics, or merely a consequence of "ordinary" quantum mechanics. The experiment of Itano, Heinzen, Bollinger, and Wineland, published in 1990, has been cited around 347 times and seems to be the one most often called a demonstration of the quantum Zeno effect. Given that there is disagreement as to what the quantum Zeno effect is, there naturally is disagreement as to whether that experiment demonstrated the quantum Zeno effect. Some differing perspectives regarding the quantum Zeno effect and what would constitute an experimental demonstration are discussed.},

The spontaneous evolution of the cloud of low orbital angular momentum (low-ℓ) Rydberg states towards an ultracold neutral plasma is observed by imaging resonant light scattered from core ions, a technique that provides both spatial and temporal resolution. Evolution is observed to be faster for the S states, which display isotropic attractive interactions, than for the D states, which exhibit anisotropic, principally repulsive interactions. Immersion of the atoms in a dilute ultracold neutral plasma speeds up the evolution and allows the number of Rydberg atoms initially created to be determined.},

abstract = {In modern physics, the classical vacuum of tranquil nothingness has been replaced by a quantum vacuum with fluctuations of measurable consequence. In The Quantum Vacuum, Peter Milonni describes the concept of the vacuum in quantum physics with an emphasis on quantum electrodynamics. He elucidates in depth and detail the role of the vacuum electromagnetic field in spontaneous emission, the Lamb shift, van der Waals, and Casimir forces, and a variety of other phenomena, some of which are of technological as well as purely scientific importance.This informative text also provides an introduction based on fundamental vacuum processes to the ideas of relativistic quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory, including renormalization and Feynman diagrams. Experimental as well as theoreticalaspects of the quantum vacuum are described, and in most cases details of mathematical derivations are included.Chapter 1 of The Quantum Vacuum - published in advance in The American Journal of Physics (1991)-was later selected by readers as one of the Most Memorable papers ever published in the 60-year history of the journal. This chapter provides anexcellent beginning of the book, introducing a wealth of information of historical interest, the results of which are carefully woven into subsequent chapters to form a coherent whole.Key Features* Does not assume that the reader has taken advanced graduate courses, making the text accessible to beginning graduate students* Emphasizes the basic physical ideas rather than the formal, mathematical aspects of the subject* Provides a careful and thorough treatment of Casimir and van der Waals forces at a level of detail not found in any other book on this topic* Clearly presents mathematical derivations},

abstract = {We study first- and second-order coherence of trapped dilute Bose gases using appropriate correlation functions. Special attention is given to the discussion of second-order or density correlations. Except for a small region around the surface of a Bose-Einstein condensate the correlations can be accurately described as those of a locally homogeneous gas with a spatially varying chemical potential. The degrees of first- and second-order coherence are therefore functions of temperature, chemical potential, and position. The second-order correlation function is governed both by the tendency of bosonic atoms to cluster and by a strong repulsion at small distances due to atomic interactions. In present experiments both effects are of comparable magnitude. Below the critical temperature the range of the bosonic correlation is affected by the presence of collective quasiparticle excitations. The results of some recent experiments on second- and third-order coherence are discussed. It is shown that the relation between the measured quantities and the correlation functions is much weaker than previously assumed. [S1050-2947(99)04405-4].},

abstract = {The quantum mechanical states of electrons in atoms and molecules are discrete spatial orbitals, which are fundamental for our understanding of atoms, molecules, and solids. They determine a wide range of basic atomic properties, ranging from the coupling to external fields to the whole field of chemistry. Nevertheless, the manifestation of electron orbitals in experiments so far has been rather indirect. In a detailed theoretical model, we analyze the impact of a single Rydberg electron onto a Bose-Einstein condensate and compare the results to experimental data. Based on this validated model we propose a method to optically image the shape of single electron orbitals using electron-phonon coupling in a Bose-Einstein condensate. This scheme requires only established and readily available experimental techniques and allows to directly capture textbook-like spatial images of single electronic orbitals in a single shot experiment.},

@article{Shlens2014,
abstract = {Abstract Skin-pass rolling is a substantial process step in the production line of sheet material for automotive applications. Textured rolls are used to emboss an immaterial surface structure on sheets for improving their formability in subsequent deep drawing operations. In this paper, state of the art techniques for texturing skin-pass rolls are discussed in order to assess their ability to meet optimal tribological parameters. Two main problems are identified: firstly, structured rolls are affected by ongoing wear limiting the operating time and necessitates perpetual maintenance. Secondly, state of the art techniques are not able to exploit the theoretically known potential of immaterial surface structures for enabling micro-lubrication mechanisms due to geometrical inadequacies. Based on these findings, a new approach for texturing of skin-pass rolls is introduced. The technique uses a localised dispersing of hard ceramic particles by use of pulsed laser radiation. It is shown in this paper that this technique allows the creation of elevated structures with high hardness on the surface of 1.2379 cold-working steel. The wear behaviour of such textured rolls was investigated in a lubricated twin-disc-test. The experiments show that no significant wear of the laser produced structures occur during the test duration. The observed results lead to the assumption that the proposed technique allows the creation of skin-pass roll structures with significantly higher durability.},

abstract = {In recent years extensive theoretical and experimental studies of universal few-body physics have led to advances in our understanding of universal Efimov physics 1. The Efimov effect, once considered a mysterious and esoteric effect, is today a reality that many experiments in ultracold quantum gases have successfully observed and continued to explore 2-14. Whereas theory was the driving force behind our understanding of Efimov physics for decades, recent experiments have contributed an unexpected discovery. Specifically, measurements have found that the so-called three-body parameter determining several properties of the system is universal, even though fundamental assumptions in the theory of the Efimov effect suggest that it should be a variable property that depends on the precise details of the short-range two- and three-body interactions. The present Letter resolves this apparent contradiction by elucidating unanticipated implications of the two-body interactions. Our study shows that the three-body parameter universality emerges because a universal effective barrier in the three-body potentials prevents the three particles from simultaneously getting close to each other. Our results also show limitations on this universality, as it is more likely to occur for neutral atoms and less likely to extend to light nuclei.},

In the case of a cylindrical condensate, we compare the results with those obtained by linearizing the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and using a quasiparticle projection method. This analysis shows how the axial-phonon branches affect the momentum transfer, in agreement with our previous interpretation of the observed data. We also discuss the applicability of this type of spectroscopy to typical available condensates, as well as the role of nonlinear effects.},

abstract = {The quantum mechanical states of electrons in atoms and molecules are discrete spatial orbitals, which are fundamental for our understanding of atoms, molecules, and solids. They determine a wide range of basic atomic properties, ranging from the coupling to external fields to the whole field of chemistry. Nevertheless, the manifestation of electron orbitals in experiments so far has been rather indirect. In a detailed theoretical model, we analyze the impact of a single Rydberg electron onto a Bose-Einstein condensate and compare the results to experimental data. Based on this validated model we propose a method to optically image the shape of single electron orbitals using electron-phonon coupling in a Bose-Einstein condensate. This scheme requires only established and readily available experimental techniques and allows to directly capture textbook-like spatial images of single electronic orbitals in a single shot experiment.},

abstract = {We report on the generation of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a gas of chromium atoms, which have an exceptionally large magnetic dipole moment and therefore underlie anisotropic long-range interactions. The preparation of the chromium condensate requires novel cooling strategies that are adapted to its special electronic and magnetic properties. The final step to reach quantum degeneracy is forced evaporative cooling of 52Cr atoms within a crossed optical dipole trap. At a critical temperature of Tc≈700 nK, we observe Bose-Einstein condensation by the appearance of a two-component velocity distribution. We are able to produce almost pure condensates with more than 50 000 condensed 52Cr atoms.},

@article{Comparat2006,
abstract = {We describe several routes to quantum degenerate gases based on simple schemes to efficiently load atoms into and evaporate them from a "dimple" crossed dipolar trap. The dimple is loaded nonadiabatically by collisions between atoms which are trapped in a reservoir which can be provided either by a dark spontaneous-force magneto-optical trap (MOT), the (aberrated) laser beam itself, or by a quadrupolar or quadratic magnetic trap. Optimal loading parameters for the dimple, relatively high temperature, and tight optical trap are derived from thermodynamic equations including possible inelastic and Majorana losses. Evaporative cooling is described by a set of simple equations, taking into account gravity, the possible occurrence of the hydrodynamical regime, Feshbach resonances, and three body recombination. The solution implies that to have efficient evaporation the elastic collisional rate (in s(-1)) must be on the order of the trap frequency and lower than 100 times the temperature in microkelvins. Following this approach Bose-Einstein condensates with more than 10(7) atoms should be obtained in much less than 1 s starting from an ordinary MOT setup.},

@article{Donley2002,
abstract = {Recent advances in the precise control of ultracold atomic systems have led to the realisation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and degenerate Fermi gases. An important challenge is to extend this level of control to more complicated molecular systems. One route for producing ultracold molecules is to form them from the atoms in a BEC. For example, a two-photon stimulated Raman transition in a Rb-87 BEC has been used to produce Rb-87(2) molecules in a single rotational-vibrational state(1), and ultracold molecules have also been formed(2) through photo-association of a sodium BEC. Although the coherence properties of such systems have not hitherto been probed, the prospect of creating a superposition of atomic and molecular condensates has initiated much theoretical work(3-7). Here we make use of a time-varying magnetic field near a Feshbach resonance(8-12) to produce coherent coupling between atoms and molecules in a Rb-85 BEC. A mixture of atomic and molecular states is created and probed by sudden changes in the magnetic field, which lead to oscillations in the number of atoms that remain in the condensate. The oscillation frequency, measured over a large range of magnetic fields, is in excellent agreement with the theoretical molecular binding energy, indicating that we have created a quantum superposition of atoms and diatomic molecules-two chemically different species.},

Realizing two-photon Rydberg excitation via a long-lived triplet state allows us to probe the thus far unexplored regime where Rydberg state decay presents the dominant decoherence mechanism. The effects of Rydberg interactions are observed in shifts, asymmetries, and broadening of the measured atom-loss spectra. The experiment is analyzed within a one-body density matrix approach, accounting for interaction-induced level shifts and dephasing through nonlinear terms that approximately incorporate correlations due to the Rydberg blockade. This description yields good agreement with our experimental observations for short excitation times. For longer excitation times, the loss spectrum is altered qualitatively, suggesting additional dephasing mechanisms beyond the standard blockade mechanism based on pure van der Waals interactions.},

The two orbital states are represented by two different (meta-)stable electronic configurations of fermionic Yb-173. A strong spin-exchange between particles in the two separate orbitals is mediated by the contact interaction between atoms, which we characterize by clock shift spectroscopy in a 3D optical lattice. We find the system to be SU(N)-symmetric within our measurement precision and characterize all relevant scattering channels for atom pairs in combinations of the ground and the excited state. Elastic scattering between the orbitals is dominated by the antisymmetric channel, which leads to the strong spin-exchange coupling. The exchange process is directly observed, by characterizing the dynamic equilibration of spin imbalances between two large ensembles in the two orbital states, as well as indirectly in atom pairs via interaction shift spectroscopy in a 3D lattice. The realization of a stable SU(N)-symmetric two-orbital Hubbard Hamiltonian opens the route towards experimental quantum simulation of condensed-matter models based on orbital interactions, such as the Kondo lattice model.},

Observation of the exponential decay after excitation by a pulsed laser in a fast atomic beam and subsequent state-selective field ionization was employed. The lifetimes of the states of the3S1-series show the expectedn*3 dependence on the effective principal quantum number, while the3D3-series is disturbed by configuration mixing. Furthermore, state re-populations induced by black-body radiation have been observed.},

The extremely small transition rate is overcome by the enhanced Franck-Condon factor of the weakly bound Feshbach molecule, allowing us to observe Rabi oscillations with long decay time between an atom pair and a molecule in an optical lattice. We also perform the precision measurement of the binding energies, which characterizes the observed resonances. The ultranarrow photoassociation will be a basis for practical implementation of optical Feshbach resonances.},

abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of Mott-insulating regions of a trapped bosonic gas as the interaction strength is changed linearly with time. The bosonic gas considered is loaded into an optical lattice and confined to a parabolic trapping potential. Two situations are addressed: the formation of Mott domains in a superfluid gas as the interaction is increased, and their melting as the interaction strength is lowered. In the first case, depending on the local filling, Mott-insulating barriers can develop and hinder the density and energy transport throughout the system. In the second case, the density and local energy adjust rapidly whereas long range correlations require longer time to settle. For both cases, we consider the time evolution of various observables: the local density and energy, and their respective currents, the local compressibility, the local excess energy, the heat and single particle correlators. The evolution of these observables is obtained using the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group technique and comparisons with time-evolutions done within the Gutzwiller approximation are provided.},

abstract = {It is possible to tune the scattering length for the collision of ultra-cold 1S0 ground state alkaline-earth atoms using an optical Feshbach resonance. This is achieved with a laser far detuned from an excited molecular level near the frequency of the atomic intercombination 1S0--3P1 transition. Simple resonant scattering theory, illustrated by the example of 40Ca, allows an estimate of the magnitude of the effect. Unlike alkali metal species, large changes of the scattering length are possible while atom loss remains small, because of the very narrow line width of the molecular photoassociation transition. This raises prospects for control of atomic interactions for a system without magnetically tunable Feshbach resonance levels.},

abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe∕CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1−xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

In case of bosonic strontium, which we discuss here, this transition has a wavelength of 2.7 {\$}\backslash{\$}mu m and a dipole moment of 2.46 Debye, and there exists a magic wavelength permitting the creation of optical lattices that are identical for the states 3P{\_}0 and 3D{\_}1. This interaction enables the realization and study of mixtures of hard-core lattice bosons featuring long-range hopping, with tuneable disorder and anisotropy. We derive the many-body Master equation, investigate the dynamics of excitation transport and analyze spectroscopic signatures stemming from coherent long-range interactions and collective dissipation. Our results show that lattice gases of alkaline-earth-metal atoms permit the creation of long-lived collective atomic states and constitute a simple and versatile platform for the exploration of many-body systems with long-range interactions. As such, they represent an alternative to current related efforts employing Rydberg gases, atoms with large magnetic moment, or polar molecules.},

abstract = {An electron propagating through a solid carries spin angular momentum in addition to its mass and charge. Of late there has been considerable interest in developing electronic devices based on the transport of spin that offer potential advantages in dissipation, size and speed over charge-based devices. However, these advantages bring with them additional complexity. Because each electron carries a single, fixed value (- e) of charge, the electrical current carried by a gas of electrons is simply proportional to its total momentum. A fundamental consequence is that the charge current is not affected by interactions that conserve total momentum, notably collisions among the electrons themselves. In contrast, the electron's spin along a given spatial direction can take on two values, +/- [planck]/2 (conventionally upward arrow, downward arrow), so that the spin current and momentum need not be proportional. Although the transport of spin polarization is not protected by momentum conservation, it has been widely assumed that, like the charge current, spin current is unaffected by electron-electron (e-e) interactions. Here we demonstrate experimentally not only that this assumption is invalid, but also that over a broad range of temperature and electron density, the flow of spin polarization in a two-dimensional gas of electrons is controlled by the rate of e-e collisions.},

abstract = {We present high-resolution two-color photoassociation spectroscopy of Bose-Einstein condensates of ytterbium atoms. The use of narrow Raman resonances and careful examination of systematic shifts enabled us to measure 13 bound-state energies for three isotopologues of the ground-state ytterbium molecule with standard uncertainties of the order of 500 Hz. The atomic interactions are modeled using an ab initio based mass-scaled Born-Oppenheimer potential whose long-range van der Waals parameters and total WKB phase are fitted to experimental data. We find that the quality of the fit of this model, of about 112.9 kHz (rms) can be significantly improved by adding the recently calculated beyond-Born-Oppenheimer (BBO) adiabatic corrections [J. J. Lutz and J. M. Hutson, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 330, 43 (2016)] and by partially treating the nonadiabatic effects using distance-dependent reduced masses. Our BBO interaction model represents the experimental data to within about 30.2 kHz on average, which is 3.7 times better than the " reference " Born-Oppenheimer model. We calculate the s-wave scattering lengths for bosonic isotopic pairs of ytterbium atoms with error bars over two orders of magnitude smaller than previous determinations. For example, the s-wave scattering length for 174 Yb is +5.55812(50) nm.},

abstract = {A fluid model for the expansion of a molecular ultracold plasma composed of NO+ ions and electrons shows that fast dissociative recombination (DR) flattens the charged-particle density distribution, effectively freezing the expansion of the plasma core. However, a much greater fraction of the plasma mass exists at lower density in the wings of the plasma, where dissociative recombination has little effect, and ion motion is driven by a Gaussian charge-density gradient. Here, expansion proceeds as the collisionless acceleration of the ions under the radial pressure of the expanding electron gas. Even though DR flattening dramatically suppresses the radial velocity of ions in the densest part of the plasma, the measured evolution of the overall plasma width remains dominated by the expansion of the outer shells. Thus, despite its frozen core, a dissociating plasma with an initial electron temperature Te(0) exhibits a time-evolving width that differs only slightly from a Vlasov expansion with the same Te(0).},

The measured density profiles show the evolution of the colliding plasmas from interpenetration, when the low-density edge of the plasmas first collide, to stagnation at the symmetry plane with density building at the symmetry plane. We compare the measured profiles with density profiles calculated by the radiation hydrodynamic code LASNEX, which predicts plasma stagnation as soon as the plasmas collide, and a particle-in-cell code, which allows for interpenetration, softening the stagnation.},

abstract = {We demonstrate control of the collapse and expansion of an 88Sr Bose-Einstein condensate using an optical Feshbach resonance near the 1S0-3P1 intercombination transition at 689 nm. Significant changes in dynamics are caused by modifications of scattering length by up to ±10abg, where the background scattering length of 88Sr is abg=-2a0 (1a0=0.053 nm). Changes in scattering length are monitored through changes in the size of the condensate after a time-of-flight measurement. Because the background scattering length is close to zero, blue detuning of the optical Feshbach resonance laser with respect to a photoassociative resonance leads to increased interaction energy and a faster condensate expansion, whereas red detuning triggers a collapse of the condensate. The results are modeled with the time-dependent nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation.},

abstract = {In the laser excitation of ultracold atoms to Rydberg states, we observe a dramatic suppression caused by van der Waals interactions. This behavior is interpreted as a local excitation blockade: Rydberg atoms strongly inhibit excitation of their neighbors. We measure suppression, relative to isolated atom excitation, by up to a factor of 6.4. The dependences of this suppression on both laser irradiance and atomic density are in good agreement with a mean-field model. These results are an important step towards using ultracold Rydberg atoms in quantum information processing.},

abstract = {The pair-interactions U{\_}{\{}ij{\}}(r) determine the thermodynamics and linear transport properties of matter via the pair-distribution functions (PDFs), i.e., g{\_}{\{}ij{\}}(r). Great simplicity is achieved if U{\_}{\{}ij{\}}(r) could be directly used to predict material properties via classical simulations, avoiding many-body wavefunctions. Warm dense matter (WDM) is encountered in quasi-equilibria where the electron temperature {\$}T{\_}e{\$} differs from the ion temperature T{\_}i, as in laser-heated or in shock-compressed matter. The electron PDFs g{\_}{\{}ee{\}}(r) as perturbed by the ions are used to evaluate fully non-local exchange-correlation corrections to the free energy, using Hydrogen as an example. Electron-ion potentials for ions with a bound core are discussed with Al and Si as examples, for WDM with T{\_}e {\$}\backslash{\$}ne T{\_}i, and valid for times shorter than the electron-ion relaxation time. In some cases the potentials develop attractive regions, and then become repulsive and `Yukawa-like' for higher {\$}T{\_}e{\$}. These results clarify the origin of initial phonon-hardening and rapid release. Pair-potentials for shock-heated WDM show that phonon hardening would not occur in most such systems. Defining meaningful quasi-equilibrium static transport coefficients consistent with the dynamic values is addressed. There seems to be no meaningful `static conductivity' obtainable by extrapolating experimental or theoretical {\$}\backslash{\$}sigma({\$}\backslash{\$}omega, T{\_}i, T{\_}e) to {\$}\backslash{\$}omega {\$}\backslash{\$}to 0, unless T{\_}i {\$}\backslash{\$}to T{\_}e as well. Illustrative calculations of quasi-static resistivities R(T{\_}i,T{\_}e) of laser-heated as well as shock-heated Aluminum and Silicon are presented using our pseudopotentials, pair-potentials and classical integral equations. The quasi-static resistivities display clear differences in their temperature evolutions, but are not the strict {\$}\backslash{\$}omega {\$}\backslash{\$}to 0 limits of the dynamic values.},

Here we numerically investigate the performance of an ultracold ion source which has the potential for generating ion beams which combine high brightness with small energy spread. The source is based on creating very cold ion beams by near-threshold photoionization of a laser-cooled and trapped atomic gas. We present ab initio numerical calculations of the generation of ultracold beams in a realistic acceleration field and including all Coulomb interactions, i.e., both space charge effects and statistical Coulomb effects. These simulations demonstrate that with existing technology reduced brightness values exceeding 10 5 A m − 2 sr − 1 V − 1 are feasible at an energy spread as low as 0.1 eV. The estimated spot size of the ultracold ion source in a FIB instrument ranges from 10 nm at a current of 100 pA to 0.8 nm at 1 pA.},

Our approach allows the control of the pair distribution in the gas and is based on a strong coupling of one transition in an atomic three-level system, while introducing specific detunings of the other transition. When the coupling energy matches the interaction energy of the Rydberg long-range interactions, the otherwise blocked excitation of close pairs becomes possible. A time-resolved spectroscopic measurement of the Penning ionization signal is used to identify slight variations in the Rydberg pair distribution of a random arrangement of atoms. A model based on a pair interaction Hamiltonian is presented which well reproduces our experimental observations and allows one to deduce the distribution of nearest-neighbor distances.},

Starting from the simple two-level atom-small sample Dicke model, we successively introduce various complications inherent to a realistic superradiance experiment: effects of Van der Waals interaction between the atoms, propagation and diffraction of the electromagnetic field in the sample and finally the effects related to atomic level degeneracy or near degeneracy. We recall how to calculate the field radiated by a superradiant system in a single experiment and how to determine, for a series of identically prepared superradiant samples, the large shot to shot fluctuations of the emitted light properties. The presentation tries to unify various points of view and formalisms developed in previous works and to introduce simply and progressively the basic physical concepts relevant to the superradiance phenomenon. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {Ultracold atoms in optical lattices have great potential to contribute to a better understanding of some of the most important issues in many-body physics, such as high-{\$}T{\_}c{\$} superconductivity. The Hubbard model describes many of the features shared by the copper oxides, including an interaction-driven Mott insulating state and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. Optical lattices filled with a two-spin-component Fermi gas of ultracold atoms can faithfully realise the Hubbard model with readily tunable parameters, and thus provide a platform for the systematic exploration of its phase diagram. Realisation of strongly correlated phases, however, has been hindered by the need to cool the atoms to temperatures as low as the magnetic exchange energy, and also by the lack of reliable thermometry. Here we demonstrate spin-sensitive Bragg scattering of light to measure AFM spin correlations in a realisation of the 3D Hubbard model at temperatures down to 1.4 times that of the AFM phase transition. This temperature regime is beyond the range of validity of a simple high-temperature series expansion, which brings our experiment close to the limit of the capabilities of current numerical techniques. We reach these low temperatures using a unique compensated optical lattice technique, in which the confinement of each lattice beam is compensated by a blue-detuned laser beam. The temperature of the atoms in the lattice is deduced by comparing the light scattering to determinantal quantum Monte Carlo and numerical linked-cluster expansion calculations. Further refinement of the compensated lattice may produce even lower temperatures which, along with light scattering thermometry, would open avenues for achieving and characterising other novel quantum states of matter, such as the pseudogap regime of the 2D Hubbard model.},

abstract = {We report the observation of cold Cs Rydberg-atom molecules bound at internuclear separations of R3–9 m. The bound states result from avoided crossings between Rydberg-atom-pair interaction potentials in an applied electric field. The molecular states can be modified by changing the applied electric field. The molecules are observed by mapping the radial separation of the two Rydberg atoms as a function of time delay between excitation and detection using the Coulomb repulsion of the ions after pulsed field ionization. Measurements were performed for 63D+65D, 64D+66D, 65D+67D and 66D+68D pairs. The experiment is in good agreement with calculations of the pair interactions for these states.},

Using infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) and exact diagonalizations, we show that in both cases the ground state is a simplex solid state with a two-fold ground state degeneracy, in which the N spins belonging to a simplex (i.e. a complete graph) form a singlet. Theses states can be seen as generalizations of valence bond solid states known to be stabilized in certain SU(2) spin models.},

abstract = {Giant impurity excitations with large binding energies are powerful probes for exploring new regimes of far out of equilibrium dynamics in few- and many-body quantum systems, as well as for in-situ observations of correlations. Motivated by recent experimental progress in spectroscopic studies of Rydberg excitations in ensembles of ultracold atoms, we develop a new theoretical approach for describing multiscale dynamics of Rydberg excitations in quantum Bose gases. We find that the crossover from few- to many-body dynamics manifests in a dramatic change in spectral profile from resolved molecular lines to broad Gaussian distributions representing a superpolaronic state in which many atoms bind to the Rydberg impurity. We discuss signatures of this crossover in the temperature and density dependence of the spectra.},

The interplay of electric dipolar repulsion and three dimensional magnetic confinement leads to a well controllable equilibrium configuration with tunable trap frequency and atomic distance.

abstract = {This dissertation describes experiments on two-photon excitation of ultracold Sr to the 3 S 1 Rydberg series and represents the first experiments exciting Rydberg atoms via an intermediate triplet excited state. Due to the narrow linewidth (7.5 kHz) of the 1 S 0 → 3 P 1 transition in Sr, this excitation scheme yields longer coherence times and less loss from the intermediate state compared to methods using the usual dipole allowed transitions. This is advantageous for realizing the possibility of Rydberg dressing, where a small amount of Rydberg character is admixed to ground state atoms allowing for continuously tunable long-range interactions. With this goal in mind, we explore the interplay of Rydberg blockade, Rydberg-Rydberg interactions, and ground-Rydberg interactions in high density, ultracold gases through Autler-Townes spectroscopy and photoassociation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules. First, we study ultra-long range Sr 2 Rydberg molecules comprising one Rydberg atom and one ground-state atom. Molecules are photo-associated from an optically trapped thermal gas of 84 Sr with lasers far-off resonance from the intermediate state and red-detuned from the atomic transition. The formation of molecules is detected as atom loss and the narrow spectroscopic features allow accurate determination of molecular binding energies as a function of principal quantum number. Comparison to theory yields good agreement and allows the first precision measurement of the electron-Sr scattering length. We then explore the density-dependent atomic photo-excitation line shapes in a thermal gas of 84 Sr in an EIT configuration in the Autler-Townes regime. This is a promising configuration for Rydberg dressing. In this configuration we find fast loss due to Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in the form of energy level shifts and dephasing. To describe these effects, we employ a modified mean-field treatment taking in the effects of correlations and are able to capture the early time dynamics of the spectra. Finally, we propose a method to detect Rydberg dressing in a BEC via low momen-tum transfer Bragg spectroscopy. We show preliminary results showing the sensitivity of this technique as well as calculations of the expected signal that it would detect.},

We provide quantitative support to our theoretical scenarios by means of first principle numerical simulations.

abstract = {The ability to control and tune interactions in ultracold atomic gases has paved the way for the realization of new phases of matter. So far, experiments have achieved a high degree of control over short-range interactions, but the realization of long-range interactions has become a central focus of research because it would open up a new realm of many-body physics. Rydberg atoms are highly suited to this goal because the van der Waals forces between them are many orders of magnitude larger than those between ground-state atoms. Consequently, mere laser excitation of ultracold gases can cause strongly correlated many-body states to emerge directly when atoms are transferred to Rydberg states. A key example is a quantum crystal composed of coherent superpositions of different, spatially ordered configurations of collective excitations. Here we use high-resolution, in situ Rydberg atom imaging to measure directly strong correlations in a laser-excited, two-dimensional atomic Mott insulator. The observations reveal the emergence of spatially ordered excitation patterns with random orientation, but well-defined geometry, in the high-density components of the prepared many-body state. Together with a time-resolved analysis, this supports the description of the system in terms of a correlated quantum state of collective excitations delocalized throughout the gas. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of Rydberg gases to realize exotic phases of matter, thereby laying the basis for quantum simulations of quantum magnets with long-range interactions.},

abstract = {Optical lattices have emerged as ideal simulators for Hubbard models of strongly correlated materials, such as the high-temperature superconducting cuprates. In optical lattice experiments, microscopic parameters such as the interaction strength between particles are well known and easily tunable. Unfortunately, this benefit of using optical lattices to study Hubbard models come with one clear disadvantage: the energy scales in atomic systems are typically nanoKelvin compared with Kelvin in solids, with a correspondingly miniscule temperature scale required to observe exotic phases such as d-wave superconductivity. The ultra-low temperatures necessary to reach the regime in which optical lattice simulation can have an impact-the domain in which our theoretical understanding fails-have been a barrier to progress in this field. To move forward, a concerted effort to develop new techniques for cooling and, by extension, techniques to measure even lower temperatures. This article will be devoted to discussing the concepts of cooling and thermometry, fundamental sources of heat in optical lattice experiments, and a review of proposed and implemented thermometry and cooling techniques.},

The availability of a strong, long-range interaction that can be coherently turned on and off is an enabling resource for a wide range of quantum information tasks stretching far beyond the original gate proposal. Rydberg enabled capabilities include long-range two-qubit gates, collective encoding of multi-qubit registers, implementation of robust light-atom quantum interfaces, and the potential for simulating quantum many body physics.

abstract = {The behavior of a mobile impurity particle interacting with a quantum-mechanical medium is of fundamental importance in physics. Due to the great flexibility of atomic gases, our understanding of the impurity problem has improved dramatically since it was realized experimentally in a particularly pure form using degenerate Fermi gases. However, there has not been such a realization of the impurity problem in a bosonic reservoir so far. Here, we use radio frequency spectroscopy of ultracold bosonic {\$}{\^{}}{\{}39{\}}{\$}K atoms to experimentally demonstrate the existence of a well-defined quasiparticle state for an impurity interacting with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). We measure the energy of the impurity both for attractive and repulsive interactions with the BEC, and find excellent agreement with theories that incorporate three-body correlations, both in the weak-coupling limits and across unitarity. Our results show that the spectral response consists of a well-defined quasiparticle peak at weak coupling and a continuum of excited many-body states. For increasing interaction strength, the spectrum is strongly broadened and becomes dominated by the many-body continuum, but no significant effects of three-body decay are observed. Our results open up intriguing prospects for studying mobile impurities in a bosonic environment, as well as strongly interacting Bose systems in general.},

abstract = {Forced evaporative cooling in a far-off-resonance optical dipole trap is proved to be an efficient method to produce fermionic- or bosonic-degenerated gases. However in most of the experiences, the reduction of the potential height occurs with a diminution of the collision elastic rate. Taking advantage of a long-living excited state, like in two-electron atoms, I propose a new scheme, based on an optical knife, where the forced evaporation can be driven independently of the trap confinement. In this context, the runaway regime might be achieved leading to a substantial improvement of the cooling efficiency. The comparison with the different methods for forced evaporation is discussed in the presence or not of three-body recombination losses.},

abstract = {The physics of quantum degenerate atomic Fermi gases in uniform as well as in harmonically trapped configurations is reviewed from a theoretical perspective. Emphasis is given to the effect of interactions that play a crucial role, bringing the gas into a superfluid phase at low temperature. In these dilute systems, interactions are characterized by a single parameter, the s-wave scattering length, whose value can be tuned using an external magnetic field near a broad Feshbach resonance. The BCS limit of ordinary Fermi superfluidity, the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of dimers, and the unitary limit of large scattering length are important regimes exhibited by interacting Fermi gases. In particular, the BEC and the unitary regimes are characterized by a high value of the superfluid critical temperature, on the order of the Fermi temperature. Different physical properties are discussed, including the density profiles and the energy of the ground-state configurations, the momentum distribution, the fraction of condensed pairs, collective oscillations and pair-breaking effects, the expansion of the gas, the main thermodynamic properties, the behavior in the presence of optical lattices, and the signatures of superfluidity, such as the existence of quantized vortices, the quenching of the moment of inertia, and the consequences of spin polarization. Various theoretical approaches are considered, ranging from the mean-field description of the BCS-BEC crossover to nonperturbative methods based on quantum Monte Carlo techniques. A major goal of the review is to compare theoretical predictions with available experimental results.},

In this "high-intensity" regime, we observe features absent in low-intensity two-frequency photoassociation. We experimentally measure the spectra of {\$}{\^{}}{\{}86{\}}{\$}Sr atoms coupled to the least bound state of the {\$}{\^{}}{\{}86{\}}{\$}Sr{\$}{\_}2{\$} ground electronic channel through an intermediate electronically excited molecular state. We compare the spectra to a simple three-level model that includes a two-frequency drive on each leg of the transition. With numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, we show that this model accurately captures (1) the existence of experimentally observed satellite peaks that arise from nonlinear processes, (2) the locations of the two-photon peak in the spectrum, including ac Stark shifts, and (3) in some cases, spectral lineshapes. To better understand these numerical results, we develop an approximate treatment of this model, based on Floquet and perturbation theory, that gives simple formulas that accurately capture the binding energies. We expect these expressions to be valuable tools to analyze and guide future two-frequency photoassociation experiments.},

The momentum states produced in this way oscillate in the trap for time scales on the order of seconds, nearly unperturbed by collisions, which are absent for ultracold fermions due to the Pauli principle. In contrast, interactions in a mixture with 87Rb atoms lead to rapid damping. The coherence of these states is demonstrated by Ramsey-type matter wave interferometry. The signal is improved using an echo pulse sequence, allowing us to observe coherence times longer than 100 mus. Finally we use Bragg spectroscopy to measure the in-situ momentum distribution of the 6Li cloud. Signatures for the degeneracy of the Fermi gas can be observed directly from the momentum distribution of the atoms inside the trap.},

@phdthesis{Rey2004,
abstract = {This thesis covers most of my work in the field of ultracold atoms loaded in optical lattices. It makes a route through the physics of cold atoms in periodic potentials starting from the simple noninteracting system and going into the many-body physics that describes the strongly correlated Mott insulator regime. Even though this thesis is a theoreticalwork all the chapters are linked either with experiments already done or with ongoing experimental efforts. This thesis can be divided into four different parts. The first part comprises chapters 1 to 3. In these chapters, after a brief introduction to the field of optical lattices I review the fundamental aspects pertaining to the physics of systems in periodic potentials. The second part deals with the superfluid weakly interacting regime where standard mean field techniques can be applied. This is covered in chapters 4 and 5. Specifically, chapter 4 introduces the discrete nonlinear Schr¨ odinger equation (DNLSE) and uses it to model some experiments. In chapter 5 I go one step further and include the small quantum fluctuations neglected in the DNLSE by studying quadratic approximations of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Chapters 6 to 8 can be grouped as the third part of the thesis. In them I adopt an effective action formalism, the so called two particle irreducible effective action (2PI) together with the closed time path (CTP) formalism to study far-from-equilibrium dynamics. The many-body techniques discussed in these chapters systematically include higher order quantum corrections, not included in the quadratic approxi- mations of the Hamiltonian, which we show are crucial for a correct description of the quantum dynamics outside the very weakly interacting regime. Finally, chapter 9 to 11 are devoted to study the Mott insulator phase. In these chapters using perturbation theory I study the Mott insulator ground state and its excitation spectrum, the response of the system to Bragg spectroscopy, and propose a mechanism to correct for the residual quantum coherences inherent to the Mott insulator ground state. Even though small these are not ideal for the use of neutral atoms in optical lattice as a tool for quantum computation.},

abstract = {In models of fast magnetic reconnection, flux transfer occurs within a small portion of a current sheet triggering stored magnetic energy to be thermalized by shocks. When the initial current sheet separates magnetic fields which are not perfectly anti-parallel, i.e., they are skewed , magnetic energy is first converted to bulk kinetic energy and then thermalized in slow magnetosonic shocks. We show that the latter resemble parallel shocks or hydrodynamic shocks for all skew angles except those very near the anti-parallel limit. As for parallel shocks, the structures of reconnection-driven slow shocks are best studied using two-fluid equations in which ions and electrons have independent temperature. Time-dependent solutions of these equations can be used to predict and understand the shocks from reconnection of skewed magnetic fields. The results differ from those found using a single-fluid model such as magnetohydrodynamics. In the two-fluid model, electrons are heated indirectly and thus carry a heat flux always well below the free-streaming limit. The viscous stress of the ions is, however, typically near the fluid-treatable limit. We find that for a wide range of skew angles and small plasma � an electron conduction front extends ahead of the slow shock but remains within the outflow jet. In such cases, conduction will play a more limited role in driving chromospheric evaporation than has been predicted based on single-fluid, anti-parallel models.},

abstract = {Fundamental interactions between particles, such as the Coulomb law, involve pairs of particles, and our understanding of the plethora of phenomena in condensed-matter physics rests on models involving effective two-body interactions. On the other hand, exotic quantum phases, such as topological phases or spin liquids, are often identified as ground states of hamiltonians with three- or more-body terms. Although the study of these phases and the properties of their excitations is currently one of the most exciting developments in theoretical condensed-matter physics, it is difficult to identify real physical systems exhibiting such properties. Here, we show that polar molecules in optical lattices driven by microwave fields naturally give rise to Hubbard models with strong nearest-neighbour three-body interactions, whereas the two-body terms can be tuned with external fields. This may open a new route for an experimental study of exotic quantum phases with quantum degenerate molecular gases.},

abstract = {Blockade effects on the single quantum level are at the heart of quantum devices like single-electron transistors. The blockade mechanisms are based on strong interactions like the Coulomb interaction in case of single electrons. Neutral atoms excited into a Rydberg state experience abnormally strong interactions that lead to the corresponding blockade effect for Rydberg atoms. In this paper we report on our measurements of a strong van der Waals blockade, showing that only one out of several thousand atoms within a blockade volume can be excited. In addition, our experimental results demonstrate the coherent nature of the excitation of magnetically trapped ultracold atoms into a Rydberg state, confirming the predicted dependence of the collective Rabi frequency on the square root of the mesoscopic system size. This collective coherent behaviour is generic for all mesoscopic systems which are able to carry only one single excitation quantum.},

In addition, it has several advantages that offer new possibilities, including high resolution ion microscopy with ion species tailored for specific applications, contamination-free ion milling, and nanoscale implantation of a variety of elements, either in large quantities, or one at a time, deterministically. Using laser-cooled Cr atoms, we create an ion beam with a normalized rms (root-mean-square) emittance of 6.0 x 10 (-7) mm mrad M e V and approximately 0.25 pA of current, yielding a brightness as high as 2.25 A cm (-2) sr (-1) eV (-1). These values of emittance and brightness show that, with suitable ion optics, an ion beam with a useful amount of current can be produced and focused to spot sizes of less than 1 nm.},

Our results agree with theoretical estimates of the magnitude and sign of the interactions.},

Using detailed theoretical models, we show the feasibility of direct excitation, predict the effect of background electric fields, and calculate the required interatomic distance to observe Rydberg blockade. We then measure and control the electric field environment to enable coherent control of Rydberg states. With this coherent control, we demonstrate Rydberg blockade of two atoms separated by 6.6(3) {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m. When compared with the more common two-photon excitation method, this single-photon approach is advantageous because it eliminates channels for decoherence through photon scattering and AC Stark shifts from the intermediate state while moderately increasing Doppler sensitivity.},

Accordingly, we present simple formulas for the effects of laser light that should prove useful in designing specific experiments. We demonstrate the validity of these formulas by comparison with exact close-coupling models. In particular, we find that useful changes of the mean-field interaction require sufficiently high laser intensities that the rate of laser-induced stimulated emission exceeds the natural spontaneous emission rate.},

This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in the research field of cold and ultracold molecules. It serves as an introduction to the focus issue of New Journal of Physics on Cold and Ultracold Molecules and describes new prospects for fundamental research and technological development. Cold and ultracold molecules may revolutionize physical chemistry and few-body physics, provide techniques for probing new states of quantum matter, allow for precision measurements of both fundamental and applied interest, and enable quantum simulations of condensed-matter phenomena. Ultracold molecules offer promising applications such as new platforms for quantum computing, precise control of molecular dynamics, nanolithography and Bose-enhanced chemistry. The discussion is based on recent experimental and theoretical work and concludes with a summary of anticipated future directions and open questions in this rapidly expanding research field.},

Our results show that the rate at which ground-state molecules may be formed saturates at high light intensities whereas the loss rate of condensate atoms does not. This is caused by the opposing roles of the short- and long-range pair correlations present near resonance under the influence of the laser and is crucial for the development of efficient photoassociation procedures in a condensate.},

This result is linked to observations in an ultracold gas of thermal bosons.

We give a simple theoretical explanation of these observations, which elucidates the effect of coherent radiation on an incoherent mixture of atoms.},

abstract = {The strong interaction between Rydberg atoms can be used to control the strength and character of the interatomic interaction in ultracold gases by weakly dressing the atoms with a Rydberg state. Elaborate theoretical proposals for the realization of various complex phases and applications in quantum simulation exist. Also a simple model has been already developed that describes the basic idea of Rydberg dressing in a two-atom basis. However, an experimental realization has been elusive so far. We present a model describing the ground state of a Bose-Einstein condensate dressed with a Rydberg level based on the Rydberg blockade. This approach provides an intuitive understanding of the transition from pure twobody interaction to a regime of collective interactions. Furthermore it enables us to calculate the deformation of a three-dimensional sample under realistic experimental conditions in mean-field approximation. We compare full three-dimensional numerical calculations of the ground state to an analytic expression obtained within Thomas-Fermi approximation. Finally we discuss limitations and problems arising in an experimental realization of Rydberg dressing based on our experimental results. Our work enables the reader to straight forwardly estimate the experimental feasibility of Rydberg dressing in realistic three-dimensional atomic samples.},

abstract = {In Rydberg atoms, at least one electron is excited to a state with a high principal quantum number. In an ultracold environment, this low-energy electron can scatter off a ground state atom allowing for the formation of a Rydberg molecule consisting of one Rydberg atom and several ground state atoms. Here we investigate those Rydberg molecules created by photoassociation for the spherically symmetric S-states. A step by step increase of the principal quantum number up to n=111 enables us to go beyond the previously observed dimer and trimer states up to a molecule, where four ground state atoms are bound by one Rydberg atom. The increase of bound atoms and the decreasing binding potential per atom with principal quantum number results finally in an overlap of spectral lines. The associated density-dependent line broadening sets a fundamental limit, for example, for the optical thickness per blockade volume in Rydberg quantum optics experiments.},

abstract = {A review of experiments and theories on ion acoustic solitons is presented. Taking into account quadratic nonlinearity in the fluid equations leads to the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation which predicts the existence of solitons. Experimental confirmation of their existence came with the availability of plasmas with large T e / T i which allows us to minimize damping. However, the experimental datas on the dependency of Mach number vs. soliton amplitude clearly shows a discrepancy with the prediction of the KdV equation. The recent theories do include the effects of finite ion temperature and those due to the trapped electron population. The inclusion of nonlinearity of order higher than quadratic leads to the notion of dressed solitons the dynamic of which has been studied numerically. A discussion of other nonlinear equations describing ion acoustic waves will also be presented.},

An appealing benchmark is offered by cold atomic gases in the unitary limit of strong interactions. Here, we study the dynamics of a transversely magnetized unitary Fermi gas in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. We observe the demagnetization of the gas, caused by diffusive spin transport. At low temperatures, the diffusion constant saturates to the conjectured quantum-mechanical lower bound ≃ ħ/m, where m is the particle mass. The development of pair correlations, indicating the transformation of the initially noninteracting gas toward a unitary spin mixture, is observed by measuring Tan's contact parameter.},

abstract = {Clocks based on optical transitions in ions and atoms are quickly moving to the forefront of the frequency standards field mainly because of the high spec- tral resolution, and therefore the potential stability and accuracy, which can be achieved. In this thesis a new optical clock based on neutral atoms trapped in an optical lattice is presented, demonstrating spectroscopy of the clock transition free of any lineshape or accuracy degradation due to atomic motion. The system simu- lates a single trapped ion clock, but allows use of thousands of atoms for improved signal to noise ratio, and clock stability. High accuracy can also be achieved as the lattice can be designed to shift the energy of the two atomic clock states equally, such that the transition frequency is unchanged. Strontium is a natural candidate for such a clock as it offers an extremely narrow optical transition (∼1 mHz) based on atomic states which are very insensitive to external fields. The strontium level structure allows efficient laser cooling to 1 µK with diode laser sources, and a con- venient wavelength of 813 nm for the zero-differential Stark shift optical lattice. The strontium lattice clock system has allowed observation of high signal-to-noise spectral features with the largest line quality factor ever observed in coherent spectroscopy (Q {\textgreater} 2×1014), attesting to the stability of the clock. The effects of nuclear spin in the Sr isotope used are explored in how it pertains to the potential accuracy of the clock. The clock accuracy is evaluated at a fractional level of 9×10−16, representing the first time a neutral atom optical clock has reached an accuracy comparable to the primary Cs fountains. The optical frequency is then measured using a fs-comb referenced to the NIST Cs standard via a calibrated hydrogen maser. The final frequency value of 429,228,004,229,874.0(1.1) Hz is in excellent agreement with other measurements from labs around the world, and represents one of the most accurate optical frequency measurements to date.},

abstract = {Introduction: Studies conducted amongst the inhabitants of high altitude suggested that systolic and diastolic blood pressures are lower in the high than in low altitude population. So a study was designed to look at the blood pressure values among permanent residents of high altitudes of rural Western Nepal. Methods: This is a descriptive cross sectional study conducted at two different altitudes (2670 and 2950 meters) of Humla District, Nepal, looking at the blood pressure values among the permanent inhabitants at these altitudes. Results: Total number of 137 subjects with 73 (53.3{\%}) from 2950 meters and 64 (46.7{\%}) from 2670 meters altitude were enrolled. Mean age of the study population was 35.29 years. Male were 57 (41.6{\%}) and female 80 (58.4{\%}). The difference in systolic blood pressures (118.59 and 114.66 mmHg, P=0.01) and mean arterial pressures (92.0 and 89.5 mmHg, P=0.02) at the altitudes of 2670 and 2950 meters were statistically significant whereas the difference in diastolic BP at these altitudes were not statistically significant. There was no significant correlation of BMI with blood pressure values and no difference was noted in the blood pressure values among the two different ethnic groups at the given altitudes. Conclusions: Lower rate of hypertension was observed among the inhabitants of high altitude of rural western Nepal. Blood pressure was found to decreases with increase in altitude among permanent inhabitants of high altitude.

The experiment uses 87Rb in an optical lattice and a Feshbach resonance near 414 G. The frequency and amplitude of the oscillations depend on magnetic field in a way that is well described by a two-level model. The observed density dependence of the oscillation frequency agrees with the theoretical expectation. We confirmed that the state produced after a half-cycle contains exactly one molecule at each lattice site. In addition, we show that for energies in a gap of the lattice band structure, the molecules cannot dissociate.},

A wide range of the two-body interaction strength 0.05 {\textless}g {\textless}3 is covered by tuning the scattering length and by loading the sample into an optical lattice. Based on the equations of state measurements, we extract the coupling constants as well as critical thermodynamic quantities in different regimes. In the superfluid and the BKT transition regimes, the extracted coupling constants show significant downshifts from the mean-field and perturbation calculations when g approaches or exceeds 1. In the BKT and the quantum critical regimes, all measured thermodynamic quantities show logarithmic dependence on the interaction strength, a tendency confirmed by the extended classical-field and renormalization calculations.},

We focus more specially the review on the dipole-dipole interactions and on the effect of the dipole blockade in the laser Rydberg excitation, which offers attractive possibilities for quantum engineering. We present first the various interactions between Rydberg atoms. The laser Rydberg excitation of such an assembly is then described with the introduction of the dipole blockade phenomenon. We report recent experiments performed in this subject by starting with the case of a pair of atoms allowing the entanglement of the wave-functions of the atoms and opening a fascinating way for the realization of quantum bits and quantum gates. We consider then several works on the blockade effect in a large assembly of atoms for three different configurations: blockade through electric-field induced dipole, through F$\backslash$"orster resonance and in van der Waals interaction. The properties of coherence and cooperativity are analyzed. Finally, we treat the role of dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms responsible for Penning ionization. The perturbation of the dipole blockade by ions and the evolution of the Rydberg towards an ultracold plasma are discussed.},

The profile of AT spectroscopy is measured experimentally and compared with the theoretical simulation considering the estimated large dephasing rates caused by interaction between Rydberg atoms, which demonstrates that splitting and profile of AT spectra are strongly dependent on the interaction between Rydberg atoms. Rabi frequency of the coupling laser and transition dipole moment of 6S1/2→ 6P3/2 are deduced via fitting the measured space variation of two splitting peaks, which is consistent with theoretical calculations.},

We report on the direct measurement of superexchange interactions with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. After preparing a spin-mixture of ultracold atoms in an antiferromagnetically ordered state, we measured coherent superexchange-mediated spin dynamics with coupling energies from 5 hertz up to 1 kilohertz. By dynamically modifying the potential bias between neighboring lattice sites, the magnitude and sign of the superexchange interaction can be controlled, thus allowing the system to be switched between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic spin interactions. We compare our findings to predictions of a two-site Bose-Hubbard model and find very good agreement, but are also able to identify corrections that can be explained by the inclusion of direct nearest-neighbor interactions.},

abstract = {In a plasma system, ion�ion instability is excited due to the counter streaming of ion beams. An experiment has been carried out to observe the ion�ion instability in a dusty plasma device and in the presence of Ar as a background gas. The experiment is performed in a double plasma device which is 90 cm in diameter and 120 cm in length, separated by a mesh grid of 81{\%} optical transparency. Glass beads of 4 �m average diameters are used as dust grains for the whole set of experiments and are allowed to fall within a particular region of the plasma column inside the system. The growth and decay rate of the ion�ion instability is observed by shifting a probe spatially away from the grid in the target section with changing dust density in the system. Experiments have been carried out under different dust density conditions. According to our experimental findings, the suppression mechanism can be discussed in terms of the dust density inside the system. The distributions of ions, which are taking part in the formation of the instability, are also observed at the respective dust composition. The instability is found to be suppressed completely at a certain critical value of the dust density ( N dcr ).},

abstract = {When liquid (4)He is cooled below 2.176 K, it undergoes a phase transition-Bose-Einstein condensation-and becomes a superfluid with zero viscosity. Once in such a state, it can flow without dissipation even through pores of atomic dimensions. Although it is intuitive to associate superflow only with the liquid phase, it has been proposed theoretically that superflow can also occur in the solid phase of (4)He. Owing to quantum mechanical fluctuations, delocalized vacancies and defects are expected to be present in crystalline solid (4)He, even in the limit of zero temperature. These zero-point vacancies can in principle allow the appearance of superfluidity in the solid. However, in spite of many attempts, such a 'supersolid' phase has yet to be observed in bulk solid (4)He. Here we report torsional oscillator measurements on solid helium confined in a porous medium, a configuration that is likely to be more heavily populated with vacancies than bulk helium. We find an abrupt drop in the rotational inertia of the confined solid below a certain critical temperature. The most likely interpretation of the inertia drop is entry into the supersolid phase. If confirmed, our results show that all three states of matter-gas, liquid and solid-can undergo Bose-Einstein condensation.},

As the coupling laser intensity was increased, the resonant TPA was transformed to EIT for the 5S(1/2) (F = 1)-5P(3/2) (F' = 2)-5D(5/2) (F″ = 3) transition. The transformation of resonant TPA into EIT was numerically calculated for various coupling laser intensities, considering all the degenerate magnetic sublevels of the 5S(1/2)-5P(3/2)-5D(5/2) transition. From the numerical results, the crossover from TPA to EIT could be understood by the decomposition of the spectrum into an EIT component owing to the pure two-photon coherence and a TPA component caused by the mixed term.},

abstract = {The standard picture of the Coulomb logarithm in the ideal plasma is controversial, the arguments for the lower cut off need revision. The two cases of far subthermal and of far superthermal electron drift motions are accessible to a rigorous analytical treatment. We show that the lower cut off {\$}b{\_}{\{}\backslashbackslashmin{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\$} is a function of symmetry and shape of the shielding cloud, it is not universal. In the subthermal case shielding is spherical and {\$}b{\_}{\{}\backslashbackslashmin{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\$} is to be identified with the de Broglie wavelength; at superthermal drift the shielding cloud exhibits cylindrical (axial) symmetry and {\$}b{\_}{\{}\backslashbackslashmin{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\$} is the classical parameter of perpendicular deflection. In both situations the cut offs are determined by the electron-ion encounters at large collision parameters. This is in net contrast to the governing standard meaning that attributes {\$}b{\_}{\{}\backslashbackslashmin{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\$} to the Coulomb singularity at vanishing collision parameters {\$}b{\$} and, consequently, assigns it universal validity. The origin of the contradictions in the traditional picture is analyzed.},

abstract = {For nearly half a century the supersolid phase of matter has remained mysterious, not only eluding experimental observation, but also generating a great deal of controversy among theorists. The recent discovery of what is interpreted as a non-classical moment of inertia at low temperature in solid 4He [E. Kim and M.H.W. Chan, Nature 427 225 (2004a); E. Kim and M.H.W. Chan, Science 305 1941 (2004b); E. Kim and M.H.W. Chan, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 115302 (2006); A.C. Clark and M.H.W. Chan, J. Low Temp. Phys. 138 853 (2005)] has elicited much excitement as a possible first observation of a supersolid phase. In the two years following the discovery, however, more puzzles than answers have been provided to the fundamental issue of whether the supersolid phase exists, in helium or any other naturally occurring condensed matter system. Presently, there is no established theoretical framework to understand the body of experimental data on 4He. Different microscopic mechanisms that have been suggested to underlie superfluidity in a perfect quantum crystal do not seem viable for 4He, for which a wealth of experimental and theoretical evidence points to an insulating crystalline ground state. This perspective addresses some of the outstanding problems with the interpretation of recent experimental observations of the apparent superfluid response in 4He (seen now by several groups, e.g. A.S. Rittner and J.D. Reppy 2006; M. Kondo, S. Takada, Y. Shibayama and K. Shirahama, Proceedings of QFS2006, Kyoto, Submitted to J. Low Temp. Phys.; A. Penzyev, Y. Yasuta and M. Kubota, Proceedings of QFS2006, Kyoto, Submitted to J. Low Temp. Phys., cond-mat/0702632.) and discusses various scenarios alternative to the homogeneous supersolid phase, such as superfluidity induced by extended defects of the crystalline structure, including grain boundaries, dislocations and anisotropic stresses. Can a metastable superfluid ‘glassy' phase exist, and can it be relevant to some of the experimental observations? One of the most interesting and unsolved fundamental questions is what interatomic potentials, given the freedom to design one, can support an ideal supersolid phase in continuous space, and can they be found in Nature.},

Rydberg atoms were excited to various nl Rydberg states via continuous two-photon excitation from a magneto-optical trap. A stimulated emission probe laser was then used to bring the Rydberg atoms down to the 6P{\$}{\_}{\{}3/2{\}}{\$} state, allowing state-dependent detection of the Rydberg atoms. Measurements of trap loss and fluorescent emission reveal information about the evolution of the Rydberg populations. In particular, population in the initial Rydberg state quickly transfers to other Rydberg states by a non-collisional mechanism, likely superradiant emission. The trap-loss measurements are consistent with black-body ionization as the dominant loss mechanism.},

In this paper, we are motivated to investigate the superfluidity of a BEC with PMI trapped in an optical lattice (OL). In particular, we explore the effects of PMI on the sound speed and the dynamical structure factor of the model system. Our numerical results, combined with the analytical results in both the weak-potential limit and the tight-binding limit, have shown that the PMI can strongly modify the sound speed of a BEC. Moreover, we have shown that the effects of PMI on sound speed can be experimentally probed via the dynamic structure factor, where the excitation strength toward the first Bogoliubov band exhibits marked difference from the non- PMI one. Our predictions of the effects of PMI on the sound speed can be tested using the Bragg spectroscopy.},

In the first step the specific heat shows a sharp feature, but the system still occupies many one-dimensional quantum states. In the second step, at a significantly lower temperature, the ground state becomes macroscopically occupied. It should be possible to verify these predictions using present-day atom traps. The two-step behavior can occur in a rather general class of anisotropic traps, including the box potential.},

In this article we review recent theoretical studies concerning the physics of such systems. Starting from a general discussion on interaction design techniques and microscopic Hamiltonians, we provide a summary of recent work focused on many-body properties of dipolar systems, including: weakly interacting Bose gases, weakly interacting Fermi gases, multilayer systems, strongly interacting dipolar gases and dipolar gases in 1D and quasi-1D geometries. Within each of these topics, purely dipolar effects and connections with experimental realizations are emphasized.},

abstract = {In this thesis I report on experiments that enter a new regime in the many body physics of ultracold atomic gases. A Bose-Einstein condensate is loaded into a three-dimensional optical lattice potential formed by a standing wave laser light field. In this novel quantum system we have been able to both realize a quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a Mott insulator, and to observe the collapse and revival of a macroscopic matter wave field. Quantum phase transitions are driven by quantum fluctuations and occur, even at zero temperature, as the relative strength of two competing energy terms in the underlying Hamiltonian is varied across a critical value. In the first part of this work I report on the observation of such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. In the superfluid ground state, each atom is spread-out over the entire lattice, whereas in the Mott insulating state, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites. We observed the reversible transition between those states and detected the gap in the excitation spectrum of the Mott insulator. A Bose-Einstein condensate is usually described by a macroscopic matter wave field. However, a quantized field underlies such a "classical" matter wave field of a Bose-Einstein condensate. The striking behavior of ultracold matter due to the field quantization and the nonlinear interactions between the atoms is the focus of the second part of this work. The matter wave field of a Bose-Einstein condensate is observed to undergo a series of collapses and revivals as time evolves. Furthermore, we show that the collisions between individual pairs of atoms lead to a fully coherent collisional phase shift in the corresponding many-particle state, which is a crucial cornerstone of proposed novel quantum computation schemes with neutral atoms. With these experiments we enter a new field of physics with ultracold quantum gases. In this strongly correlated regime, interactions between atoms dominate the behavior of the many-body system such that it can no longer be described by the usual theories for weakly interacting Bose gases. This novel quantum system offers the unique possibility to experimentally address fundamental questions of modern solid state physics, atomic physics, quantum optics, and quantum information.},

Such a high symmetry is expected to give rise to a variety of novel phenomena ranging from molecular Luttinger liquids to (symmetry-protected) topological phases. We review some of the phases that can be stabilized in a one dimensional lattice. The physics of this multi-component Fermi gas turns out to be much richer and more exotic than in the standard SU(2) case. For N{\textgreater}. 2, the phase diagram is quite rich already in the case of the single-band model, including a molecular Luttinger liquid (with dominant superfluid instability in the N-particle channel) for incommensurate fillings, as well as various Mott-insulating phases occurring at commensurate fillings. Particular attention will be paid to the cases with additional orbital degree of freedom (which is accessible experimentally either by taking into account two atomic states or by putting atoms in the p-band levels). We introduce two microscopic models which are relevant for these cases and discuss their symmetries and strong coupling limits. More intriguing phase diagrams are then presented including, for instance, symmetry protected topological phases characterized by non-trivial edge states.},

Here we describe how a relatively simple apparatus consisting of a single fixed-length optical cavity can be used to narrow the linewidth of the two different wavelength lasers required for STIRAP simultaneously. The frequency of each of these lasers is referenced to the cavity and is continuously tunable away from the cavity modes through the use of non-resonant electrooptic modulators. Self-heterodyne measurements suggest the laser linewidths are reduced to several hundred Hz. In the context of 87Rb133Cs molecules produced via magnetoassociation on a Feshbach resonance, we demonstrate the performance of the laser system through one- and two-photon molecular spectroscopy. Finally, we demonstrate transfer of the molecules to the rovibrational ground state using STIRAP.},

We also show that by adding an artificial uniform magnetic field with flux per plaquette {\$}2\backslashpi/N{\$}, the chiral spin liquid becomes the ground state for all {\$}N\backslashge 3{\$} at large interactions, persists to weaker interactions, and its spin gap increases, suggesting that the spin liquid physics will persist to higher temperatures.

abstract = {Since their first experimental observation, ultralong-range Rydberg molecules consisting of a highly excited Rydberg atom and a ground state atom have attracted the interest in the field of ultracold chemistry. Especially the intriguing properties like size, polarizability and type of binding they inherit from the Rydberg atom are of interest. An open question in the field is the reduced lifetime of the molecules compared to the corresponding atomic Rydberg states. In this letter we present an experimental study on the lifetimes of the {\^{}}3$\backslash$Sigma (5s-35s) molecule in its vibrational ground state and in an excited state. We show that the lifetimes depends on the density of ground state atoms and that this can be described in the frame of a classical scattering between the molecules and ground state atoms. We also find that the excited molecular state has an even more reduced lifetime compared to the ground state which can be attributed to an inward penetration of the bound atomic pair due to imperfect quantum reflection that takes place in the special shape of the molecular potential.},

abstract = {We investigate theoretically the suppression of two-body losses when the on-site loss rate is larger than all other energy scales in a lattice. This work quantitatively explains the recently observed suppression of chemical reactions between two rotational states of fermionic KRb molecules confined in one-dimensional tubes with a weak lattice along the tubes [Yan et al., Nature (London) 501, 521 (2013)]. New loss rate measurements performed for different lattice parameters but under controlled initial conditions allow us to show that the loss suppression is a consequence of the combined effects of lattice confinement and the continuous quantum Zeno effect. A key finding, relevant for generic strongly reactive systems, is that while a single-band theory can qualitatively describe the data, a quantitative analysis must include multiband effects. Accounting for these effects reduces the inferred molecule filling fraction by a factor of 5. A rate equation can describe much of the data, but to properly reproduce the loss dynamics with a fixed filling fraction for all lattice parameters we develop a mean-field model and benchmark it with numerically exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group calculations.},

abstract = {The long-range forces that act between neutral atoms and molecules have been known as dispersion forces since the work of London, who was the first to make manifest the connection between these forces and the dispersion of light by atoms, already guessed at by Newton. The analysis and application of the analyticity properties of scattering amplitudes, developed several decades ago in the context of quantum field theory, is known as dispersion theory. In this article we review the approach to dispersion forces based on dispersion theory. We give a general discussion of the concept of potential in quantum field theory and then show how a study of two-photon exchange amplitudes leads to a model-independent derivation and generalization of the formulas describing retarded dispersion forces for the case of two neutral atoms, first obtained by Casimir and Polder. We then review later extentions to the interaction of a charged and a neutral system and recent work on the case where both systems are charged. The connection between the dispersion-theory approach and more conventional methods is described. We also illustrate the use of dispersion-theory techniques to study forces arising from two-neutrino exchange and two-meson exchange. The effect of dispersion forces on the energy levels of the Rydberg states of hilium is briefly sketched. Finally, some open questions are mentioned.},

When the lattice sites are converted into biased double wells, we detect a discrete set of steps in the well population for increasing bias potentials. These correspond to tunneling resonances where the atom number on each side of the barrier changes one by one. This allows us to count and control the number of atoms within a given well. By evaluating the amplitude of the different plateaus, we can fully determine the number distribution of the atoms in the lattice, which we demonstrate for the case of a superfluid and Mott insulating regime of 87Rb.},

abstract = {Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories are of central importance in many areas of physics. In condensed matter physics, Abelian U(1) lattice gauge theories arise in the description of certain quantum spin liquids. In quantum information theory, Kitaev's toric code is a Z(2) lattice gauge theory. In particle physics, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the non-Abelian SU(3) gauge theory of the strong interactions between quarks and gluons, is non-perturbatively regularized on a lattice. Quantum link models extend the concept of lattice gauge theories beyond the Wilson formulation, and are well suited for both digital and analog quantum simulation using ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices. Since quantum simulators do not suffer from the notorious sign problem, they open the door to studies of the real-time evolution of strongly coupled quantum systems, which are impossible with classical simulation methods. A plethora of interesting lattice gauge theories suggests itself for quantum simulation, which should allow us to address very challenging problems, ranging from confinement and deconfinement, or chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration at finite baryon density, to color superconductivity and the real-time evolution of heavy-ion collisions, first in simpler model gauge theories and ultimately in QCD.},

abstract = {Onlysomeone with a short-range view could fail to be awareof the great importance of long-range interactions. Indeed, from thelate 18th century, when Coulomb discovered that the electrostatic interactionhas the same 1/r2 force law that Newton had foundfor the gravitational interaction, until perhaps the 1930s, when thestrong and weak interactions began to be understood, long-range interactionslargely were the subject of physics. By long-range interactions Imean not only those for which the potential behaves as1/r for all r but those whose potentials behave asymptoticallyas some power of 1/r. These originate in 1/r potentialsand include, for example, the van der Waals 1/r6 interaction(as calculated nonrelativistically) between two spherically symmetric atoms at alarge separation r, and multipole interactions between charge distributions. Long-rangepotentials therefore not only play a vital role in astrophysicsvia Newton's law of gravitation and a significant role innuclear physics via Coulomb's law, but determine almost all ofatomic, molecular and condensed-matter physics. {\textcopyright}1986 American Institute of Physics},

The excitation spectrum displays a linear phonon regime, as well as a parabolic single-particle regime. The linear regime provides an upper limit for the superfluid critical velocity, by the Landau criterion. The excitation spectrum agrees well with the Bogoliubov spectrum in the local density approximation, even close to the long-wavelength limit of the region of applicability. Feynman's relation between omega(k) and S(k) is verified, within an overall constant.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the precise control of ultracold atomic systems have led to the realisation of Bose Einstein condensates (BECs) and degenerate Fermi gases. An important challenge is to extend this level of control to more complicated molecular systems. One route for producing ultracold molecules is to form them from the atoms in a BEC. For example, a two-photon stimulated Raman transition in a (87)Rb BEC has been used to produce (87)Rb(2) molecules in a single rotational-vibrational state, and ultracold molecules have also been formed through photoassociation of a sodium BEC. Although the coherence properties of such systems have not hitherto been probed, the prospect of creating a superposition of atomic and molecular condensates has initiated much theoretical work. Here we make use of a time-varying magnetic field near a Feshbach resonance to produce coherent coupling between atoms and molecules in a (85)Rb BEC. A mixture of atomic and molecular states is created and probed by sudden changes in the magnetic field, which lead to oscillations in the number of atoms that remain in the condensate. The oscillation frequency, measured over a large range of magnetic fields, is in excellent agreement with the theoretical molecular binding energy, indicating that we have created a quantum superposition of atoms and diatomic molecules two chemically different species.},

abstract = {The non-equilibrium dynamics of a gas of cold atoms in which Rydberg states are off-resonantly excited is studied in the presence of noise. The interplay between interaction and off-resonant excitation leads to an initial dynamics where aggregates of excited Rydberg atoms slowly nucleate and grow, eventually reaching long-lived meta-stable arrangements which then relax further on much longer timescales. This growth dynamics is governed by an effective Master equation which permits a transparent and largely analytical understanding of the underlying physics. By means of extensive numerical simulations we study the many-body dynamics and the correlations of the resulting non-equilibrium states in various dimensions. Our results provide insight into the dynamical richness of strongly interacting Rydberg gases in noisy environments, and highlight the usefulness of these kind of systems for the exploration of soft-matter-type collective behaviour.},

Hysteresis is observed when the temperature is varied rapidly in a heating and cooling cycle. As in the experiment, transient solid superheating, but not liquid supercooling, is observed. Solid superheating, which is characterized by solid structure above the melting point, is found to be promoted by a higher rate of temperature increase.},

abstract = {We show that there are effective three- and higher-body interactions generated by the two-body
collisions of atoms confined in the lowest vibrational states of a three-dimensional (3D) optical
lattice. The collapse and revival dynamics of approximate coherent states loaded into a lattice are
a particularly sensitive probe of these higher-body interactions; the visibility of interference
fringes depend on both two-, three- and higher-body energy scales, and these produce an initial
dephasing that can help explain the surprisingly rapid decay of revivals seen in experiments. If
inhomogeneities in the lattice system are sufficiently reduced, longer timescale partial and nearly
full revivals will be visible. Using Feshbach resonances or control of the lattice potential it is
possible to tune the effective higher-body interactions and simulate effective field theories in
optical lattices.},

abstract = {We study the behavior of a Bose-Einstein condensate in which atoms are weakly coupled to a highly excited Rydberg state. Since the latter have very strong van der Waals interactions, this coupling induces effective, nonlocal interactions between the dressed ground state atoms, which, opposed to dipolar interactions, are isotropically repulsive. Yet, one finds partial attraction in momentum space, giving rise to a roton-maxon excitation spectrum and a transition to a supersolid state in three-dimensional condensates. A detailed analysis of decoherence and loss mechanisms suggests that these phenomena are observable with current experimental capabilities.},

@article{Maguire2004,
abstract = {Rotary voice-coil motors from computer hard disk drives make excellent mechanical shutters for light beams. However, the complexity of the necessary electronic driving circuit can hinder their application. A new design is presented here, using a single integrated circuit originally intended for controlling dc motors. A digital input signal switches a unipolar power supply bidirectionally through the voice coil. Short high-current pulses are generated on the transitions to ensure rapid shutter action, while a low holding current reduces the power requirement and heating of the actuator. The circuit can reverse the current to brake the shutter and reduce the impact at the end of its travel. With a focused laser beam, the shutter achieves rise times below 500 ns. A method for producing variable length pulses is also described, demonstrating durations as short as 700 ns.},

abstract = {The collective behavior of a many-body system near a continuous phase transition is insensitive to the details of its microscopic physics[1]. Characteristic features near the phase transition are that the thermodynamic observables follow generalized scaling laws[1]. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition[2,3] in two-dimensional (2D) Bose gases presents a particularly interesting case because the marginal dimensionality and intrinsic scaling symmetry[4] result in a broad fluctuation regime which manifests itself in an extended range of universal scaling behavior. Studies on BKT transition in cold atoms have stimulated great interest in recent years[5-10], clear demonstration of a critical behavior near the phase transition, however, has remained an elusive goal. Here we report the observation of a scale-invariant, universal behavior of 2D gases through in-situ density and density fluctuation measurements at different temperatures and interaction strengths. The extracted thermodynamic functions confirm a wide universal region near the BKT phase transition, provide a sensitive test to the universality prediction by classical-field theory[11,12] and quantum Monte Carlo (MC) calculations[13], and point toward growing density-density correlations in the fluctuation region. Our assay raises new perspectives to explore further universal phenomena in the realm of classical and quantum critical physics.},

The plasma stopping power problem, of great interest in its own right, provides an especially stringent test of a velocity-dependent transport property. We have performed large-scale (∼104–106 particles) molecular dynamics simulations of charged-particle stopping in a classical electron gas that span the weak to moderately strong intratarget coupling regimes. Projectile-target coupling is varied with projectile charge and velocity. Comparisons are made with disparate kinetic theories (both Boltzmann and Lenard-Balescu classes) and fully convergent theories to establish regimes of validity. We extend these various stopping models to improve agreement with the MD data and provide a useful fit to our results.},

For off-resonant excitation of such systems in the dissipative regime, highly correlated many-body states exhibiting, among other characteristics, intermittency and multi-modal counting distributions are expected to be created. So far, experiments with Rydberg atoms have been carried out in the resonant, non-dissipative regime. Here we realize a dissipative gas of rubidium Rydberg atoms and measure its full counting statistics for both resonant and off-resonant excitation. We find strongly bimodal counting distributions in the off-resonant regime that are compatible with intermittency due to the coexistence of dynamical phases. Moreover, we measure the phase diagram of the system and find good agreement with recent theoretical predictions. Our results pave the way towards detailed studies of many-body effects in Rydberg gases.},

We populate these states through the ultraviolet excitation of weakly bound molecules, and access a regime of trilobitelike states at low principal quantum numbers and with vibrational turning points around 35 Bohr radii. This demonstrates that, unlike previous studies that used free-to-bound transitions, trilobitelike states can also be excited through bound-to-bound transitions. This approach provides high excitation probabilities without requiring high-density samples, and affords the ability to control the excitation radius by selection of the initial-state vibrational level.},

abstract = {We investigate the computational power of creating steady-states of quantum dissipative systems whose evolution is governed by time-independent and local couplings to a memoryless environment. We show that such a model allows for efficient universal quantum computation with the result of the computation encoded in the steady state. Due to the purely dissipative nature of the process, this way of doing quantum computation exhibits some inherent robustness and defies some of the DiVincenzo criteria for quantum computation. We show that there is a natural class of problems that can be solved with such a model - the preparation of ground states of frustration free quantum Hamiltonians. This allows for robust and efficient creation of exotic states that exhibit features like topological quantum order and the creation of PEPS and it proves the existence of novel dissipative phase transitions. In particular the latter can in principle be verified experimentally with present day technology such as with optical lattices.},

abstract = {In recent years, experiments by several groups have demonstrated spontaneous coherence in polariton systems, which can be viewed as a type of nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation. In these systems, the polariton lifetime is longer than, but not much longer than, the polariton-polariton scattering time which leads to the thermalization. By contrast, over the past twenty years several groups have pursued experiments in a different system, which has very long exciton lifetime, up to 30 microseconds or more, essentially infinite compared to the thermalization time of the excitons. Thermal equilibrium of this type of exciton in a trap has been demonstrated experimentally. In this system, the interactions between the excitons are not short-range contact interactions, but instead are dipole-dipole interactions, with the force at long range going as {\$}1/r{\^{}}{\{}3{\}}{\$}. Up to now there has not been a universally accepted demonstration of BEC in this type of system, and the way forward will require better understanding of the many-body effects of the excitons. I review what has been learned and accomplished in the past two decades in the search for an equilibrium BEC in this promising system.},

@article{jmh07,
abstract = {Fifty years ago, Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) discovered photon bunching in light emitted by a chaotic source, highlighting the importance of two-photon correlations and stimulating the development of modern quantum optics. The quantum interpretation of bunching relies on the constructive interference between amplitudes involving two indistinguishable photons, and its additive character is intimately linked to the Bose nature of photons. Advances in atom cooling and detection have led to the observation and full characterization of the atomic analogue of the HBT effect with bosonic atoms. By contrast, fermions should reveal an antibunching effect (a tendency to avoid each other). Antibunching of fermions is associated with destructive two-particle interference, and is related to the Pauli principle forbidding more than one identical fermion to occupy the same quantum state. Here we report an experimental comparison of the fermionic and bosonic HBT effects in the same apparatus, using two different isotopes of helium: (3)He (a fermion) and 4He (a boson). Ordinary attractive or repulsive interactions between atoms are negligible; therefore, the contrasting bunching and antibunching behaviour that we observe can be fully attributed to the different quantum statistics of each atomic species. Our results show how atom-atom correlation measurements can be used to reveal details in the spatial density or momentum correlations in an atomic ensemble. They also enable the direct observation of phase effects linked to the quantum statistics of a many-body system, which may facilitate the study of more exotic situations.},

Drawing on the analogy between photons and atoms, comparable observations have been made studying expanding Bose gases. We have used two-point density correlations to study how matter-wave coherence is established when crossing the Bose-Einstein condensation threshold. Our experiments reveal a persistent multimode character of the source, also significantly below the condensation threshold temperature. Complex quantum correlations are observed for a variety of source geometries, from quasi-isotropic to highly elongated. Ideal Bose gas theory reproduces most of the qualitative features of our measurements, however a quantitative analysis highlights the need for a more comprehensive theoretical description including particle interactions.},

Using the Two-Particle Self-Consistent Approach as well as Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide isentropic curves for the two- and three-dimensional Hubbard models at half-filling. These quantitative results are important for practical attempts to reach the ordered antiferromagnetic phase in experiments on optical lattices of two-component fermions. We find that adiabatically turning on the interaction in two dimensions to cool the system is not very effective. In three dimensions, adiabatic cooling to the antiferromagnetic phase can be achieved in such a manner although the cooling efficiency is not as high as initially suggested by Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. Adiabatic cooling by turning off the repulsion beginning at strong coupling is possible in certain cases.},

abstract = {Ultra-cold atom experiments offer the unique opportunity to study mixing of different types of superfluid states. Our interest is in superfluid mixtures comprising particles with different statistics- Bose and Fermi. Such scenarios occur naturally, for example, in dense QCD matter. Interestingly, cold atomic experiments are performed in traps with finite spatial extent, thus critically destabilizing the occurrence of various homogeneous phases. Critical to this analysis is the understanding that the trapped system can undergo phase separation, resulting in a unique situation where phase transition in either species (bosons or fermions) can overlap with the phase separation between possible phases. In the present work, we illustrate how this intriguing interplay manifests in an interacting 2-species atomic mixture - one bosonic and another fermionic with two spin components - within a realistic trap configuration. We further show that such interplay of transitions can render the nature of the ground state to be highly sensitive to the experimental parameters and the dimensionality of the system.},

abstract = {In this paper we formulate the time-dependent many-body theory of photoassociation in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate with realistic interatomic interactions, using and comparing two approximations: the first-order cumulant approximation, originally developed by Kohler and Burnett [Phys. Rev. A 65, 033601 (2002)], and the reduced pair wave approximation, based on a previous paper [Phys. Rev. A 68 033612 (2003)] generalizing to two channels the Cherny-Shanenko approach [Phys. Rev. E 62, 1046 (2000)]. The two approximations differ only by the way a pair of condensate atoms is influenced by the mean field at short interatomic separations. For these approximations we identify two different regimes of photoassociation: the adiabatic regime and the coherent regime. The threshold for the so-called "rogue dissociation" [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 090403 (2002)] (where mean-field theory breaks down) is found to be different in each regime, which sheds new light on the experiment of McKenzie et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 120403 (2002)] and previous theoretical calculations. We then use the two approximations to investigate numerically the effects of rogue dissociation in a sodium condensate under conditions similar to the McKenzie et al experiment. We find two different effects: reduction of the photoassociation rate at short times, and creation of correlated pairs of atoms, confirming previous works. We also observe that the photoassociation line shapes become asymmetric in the first-order cumulant approximation, while they remain symmetric in the reduced pair wave approximation, giving the possibility to experimentally distinguish between the two approximations.},

We not only observe the density shift as discovered by Amaldi and Segr{\`{e}} in 1934, but a line shape that changes with the principal quantum number n. The line broadening depends precisely on the interaction potential energy curves of the Rydberg electron with the neutral atom perturbers. In particular, we show the relevance of the triplet p-wave shape resonance in the e{\^{}}{\{}-{\}}-Rb(5S) scattering, which significantly modifies the interaction potential. With a peak density of 5.5×10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}} cm{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}, and therefore an interparticle spacing of 1300 a{\_}{\{}0{\}} within a Bose-Einstein condensate, the potential energy curves can be probed at these Rydberg ion-neutral atom separations. We present a simple microscopic model for the spectroscopic line shape by treating the atoms overlapped with the Rydberg orbit as zero-velocity, uncorrelated, pointlike particles, with binding energies associated with their ion-neutral separation, and good agreement is found.},

Together with a comparison to ab initio dynamical mean field theory calculations, we show how the system evolves for increasing confinement from a compressible dilute metal over a strongly interacting Fermi liquid into a band-insulating state.

We tabulate wavelengths at which the trapping potential vanishes for the ns, np, and nd Rydberg states of Na and Rb atoms and discuss advantages of using such optical lattices for state-selective trapping of Rydberg atoms. We also develop exact analytical expressions for the lattice-induced polarizability for the mz=0 Rydberg states and derive an accurate formula predicting tune-out wavelengths at which the optical trapping potential becomes invisible to Rydberg atoms in targeted l=0 states.},

Ultracold 85Rb atoms sitting in a dc magnetic field near the 155 G Feshbach resonance are associated by applying a small sinusoidal oscillation to the magnetic field. There is resonant atom to molecule conversion when the modulation frequency closely matches the molecular binding energy. We observe that the atom to molecule conversion efficiency depends strongly on the frequency, amplitude, and duration of the applied modulation and on the phase space density of the sample. This technique offers high conversion efficiencies without the necessity of crossing or closely approaching the Feshbach resonance and allows precise spectroscopic measurements. Efficiencies of 55{\%} have been observed for pure Bose-Einstein condensates.},

We show that because of bosonic enhancement, pair formation is shifted to the atomic side of the original resonance (where scattering length {\$}a{\_}s{\textless}0{\$}), opposite to the fermionic case.

Here, we extend coherent control of such reactions to the photoassociation of dimer states in highly excited electronic states. We demonstrate coherent transfer of initially free pairs of rubidium ground-state atoms to ultralong-range Rydberg molecules consisting of a highly excited Rydberg atom and a ground-state atom4, 5. The coherent evolution of the molecular system is monitored in echo and Ramsey-pulse sequences by measuring the timescales for the energy-conserving dephasing rate, T2, and for non-energy-conserving decay processes, T1.

We have used this analytic wave function with the reflection approximation formula for calculating Franck-Condon factors for photoassociative spectroscopy. Numerical tests show very satisfactory agreement between the resulting analytic formula and the fully quantum numerical results in most cases investigated. Finally, we show in a model case that our analytical wave function enables us to relate the scattering length directly to a preasymp-totic node in the ground-state wave function, which in principle can be measured by photoassociative spectroscopy.

We demonstrate a Landau-Zener sweep across such a resonance, driving a quantum phase transition between a paramagnet and an antiferromagnet. Direct extensions produce gauge fields and site-resolved spin flips, for topological physics and quantum computing.},

While a superfluid gas shows molecule formation for all parameters, a Mott insulator with {\$}n=1{\$} filling reveals a strong suppression of the number of formed molecules. In the limit of weak probing, the technique can be used to probe the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition in real-time.

abstract = {We study coherent photoassociation, phenomena analogous to coherent optical transients in few-level systems, which may take place in photoassociation of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate but not in a nondegenerate gas. We develop a second-quantized Hamiltonian to describe photoassociation, and apply the Hamiltonian both in the momentum representation and in the position representation (field theory). The solution of the two-mode problem, including only one mode each for the atomic and molecular condensates, displays analogs of Rabi oscillations and rapid adiabatic passage. A classical version of the field theory for atoms and molecules is used to demonstrate that, in the presence of photoassociating light, a joint atom-molecule condensate is unstable against the growth of density fluctuations. Experimental complications, including spontaneous emission and unwanted “rogue” photodissociation from a photoassociated molecule, are analyzed. A two-color Raman scheme is studied as a method to set up an effective two-mode scheme with reduced spontaneous-emission losses. We discuss photoassociation rates and photoassociation Rabi frequencies for high-lying vibrational states in alkali dimers both on the basis of molecular-structure calculations, and by comparing with an experiment [Wynar et al., Science 287, 1016 (2000)].},

@article{ftc07,
abstract = {Tunnelling of material particles through a classically impenetrable barrier constitutes one of the hallmark effects of quantum physics. When interactions between the particles compete with their mobility through a tunnel junction, intriguing dynamical behaviour can arise because the particles do not tunnel independently. In single-electron or Bloch transistors, for example, the tunnelling of an electron or Cooper pair can be enabled or suppressed by the presence of a second charge carrier due to Coulomb blockade. Here we report direct, time-resolved observations of the correlated tunnelling of two interacting ultracold atoms through a barrier in a double-well potential. For the regime in which the interactions between the atoms are weak and tunnel coupling dominates, individual atoms can tunnel independently, similar to the case of a normal Josephson junction. However, when strong repulsive interactions are present, two atoms located on one side of the barrier cannot separate, but are observed to tunnel together as a pair in a second-order co-tunnelling process. By recording both the atom position and phase coherence over time, we fully characterize the tunnelling process for a single atom as well as the correlated dynamics of a pair of atoms for weak and strong interactions. In addition, we identify a conditional tunnelling regime in which a single atom can only tunnel in the presence of a second particle, acting as a single atom switch. Such second-order tunnelling events, which are the dominating dynamical effect in the strongly interacting regime, have not been previously observed with ultracold atoms. Similar second-order processes form the basis of superexchange interactions between atoms on neighbouring lattice sites of a periodic potential, a central component of proposals for realizing quantum magnetism.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen tremendous progress in creating complex atomic many-body quantum systems. One approach is to use macroscopic, effectively thermodynamic ensembles of ultracold atoms to create quantum gases and strongly correlated states of matter, and to analyse the bulk properties of the ensemble. For example, bosonic and fermionic atoms in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice can be used for quantum simulations of solid-state models. The opposite approach is to build up microscopic quantum systems atom-by-atom, with complete control over all degrees of freedom. The atoms or ions act as qubits and allow the realization of quantum gates, with the goal of creating highly controllable quantum information systems. Until now, the macroscopic and microscopic strategies have been fairly disconnected. Here we present a quantum gas 'microscope' that bridges the two approaches, realizing a system in which atoms of a macroscopic ensemble are detected individually and a complete set of degrees of freedom for each of them is determined through preparation and measurement. By implementing a high-resolution optical imaging system, single atoms are detected with near-unity fidelity on individual sites of a Hubbard-regime optical lattice. The lattice itself is generated by projecting a holographic mask through the imaging system. It has an arbitrary geometry, chosen to support both strong tunnel coupling between lattice sites and strong on-site confinement. Our approach can be used to directly detect strongly correlated states of matter; in the context of condensed matter simulation, this corresponds to the detection of individual electrons in the simulated crystal. Also, the quantum gas microscope may enable addressing and read-out of large-scale quantum information systems based on ultracold atoms.},

Details of the beam properties (brightness, forward velocity distribution, transverse velocity spread, rotational and vibrational temperatures) are measured under varying conditions for the molecular species SrF. Under typical conditions we produce a beam of brightness 1.2 x 10{\^{}}11 molecules/sr/pulse in the rovibrational ground state, with 140 m/s forward velocity and a rotational temperature of approximately 1 K. This source compares favorably to other methods for producing beams of free radicals and refractory species for many types of experiments. We provide details of construction that may be helpful for others attempting to use this method.},

In dramatic contrast to SU(2) magnetism, more than two spins are required to form a singlet. On the square lattice, the classical ground state is highly degenerate and magnetic order is thus unlikely. In a large-N limit, we find a chiral spin liquid ground state with topological order and Abelian fractional statistics. We discuss its experimental detection. Chiral spin liquids with non-Abelian anyons may also be realizable with alkaline earth atoms.},

abstract = {In a pioneering experiment, Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) demonstrated that noise correlations could be used to probe the properties of a (bosonic) particle source through quantum statistics; the effect relies on quantum interference between possible detection paths for two indistinguishable particles. HBT correlations--together with their fermionic counterparts--find numerous applications, ranging from quantum optics to nuclear and elementary particle physics. Spatial HBT interferometry has been suggested as a means to probe hidden order in strongly correlated phases of ultracold atoms. Here we report such a measurement on the Mott insulator phase of a rubidium Bose gas as it is released from an optical lattice trap. We show that strong periodic quantum correlations exist between density fluctuations in the expanding atom cloud. These spatial correlations reflect the underlying ordering in the lattice, and find a natural interpretation in terms of a multiple-wave HBT interference effect. The method should provide a useful tool for identifying complex quantum phases of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atoms.},

abstract = {Recent experimental progress in controlling neutral group-II atoms for optical clocks, and in the production of degenerate gases with group-II atoms has given rise to novel opportunities to address challenges in quantum computing and quantum simulation. In these systems, it is possible to encode qubits in nuclear spin states, which are decoupled from the electronic state in the {\$}{\^{}}1{\$}S{\$}{\_}0{\$} ground state and the long-lived {\$}{\^{}}3{\$}P{\$}{\_}0{\$} metastable state on the clock transition. This leads to quantum computing scenarios where qubits are stored in long lived nuclear spin states, while electronic states can be accessed independently, for cooling of the atoms, as well as manipulation and readout of the qubits. The high nuclear spin in some fermionic isotopes also offers opportunities for the encoding of multiple qubits on a single atom, as well as providing an opportunity for studying many-body physics in systems with a high spin symmetry. Here we review recent experimental and theoretical progress in these areas, and summarise the advantages and challenges for quantum computing and quantum simulation with group-II atoms.},

The atoms remaining in the initial state are essentially unaffected. We demonstrate the technique, discuss its applicability, and compare its performance as a minimally-destructive technique to that of phase-contrast imaging.},

Here we report on the experimental realization of chiral edge states in a ribbon geometry with an ultracold gas of neutral fermions subjected to an artificial gauge field. By imaging individual sites along a synthetic dimension, we detect the existence of the edge states, investigate the onset of chirality as a function of the bulk-edge coupling, and observe the edge-cyclotron orbits induced during a quench dynamics. The realization of fermionic chiral edge states is a fundamental achievement, which opens the door towards experiments including edge state interferometry and the study of non-Abelian anyons in atomic systems.},

It begins with a simplified introduction to op- tical forces on atoms, including both cooling and trapping. Then its three main sections discuss its three se- lected features, (1) quantization of atomic motion, (2) effects of the multilevel structure of atoms, and (3) the effects of polychromatic light. Each of these features is an expansion in a different direction from the simplest model of a classical, two-level atom moving in a monochromatic laser field.},

abstract = {Although used in academic research for several decades, 3D culture models have long been regarded expensive, cumbersome and unnecessary in drug development processes. Technical advances, coupled with recent observations showing that gene expression in 3D is much closer to clinical expression profiles than those seen in 2D, have renewed attention and generated hope in the feasibility of maturing organotypic 3D systems to therapy test platforms with greater power to predict clinical efficacies. Here we describe a standardized setup for reproducible, easy-handling culture, treatment and routine analysis of multicellular spheroids, the classical 3D culture system resembling many aspects of the pathophysiological situation in human tumor tissue. We discuss essential conceptual and practical considerations for an adequate establishment and use of spheroid-based drug screening platforms and also provide a list of human carcinoma cell lines, partly on the basis of the NCI-DTP 60-cell line screen, that produce treatable spheroids under identical culture conditions. In contrast to many other settings with which to achieve similar results, the protocol is particularly useful to be integrated into standardized large-scale drug test routines as it requires a minimum number of defined spheroids and a limited amount of drug. The estimated time to run the complete screening protocol described herein--including spheroid initiation, drug treatment and determination of the analytical end points (spheroid integrity, and cell survival through the acid phosphatase assay)--is about 170 h. Monitoring of spheroid growth kinetics to determine growth delay and regrowth, respectively, after drug treatment requires long-term culturing ({\textgreater}or =14 d).},

abstract = {The fundamental concept of superfluidity gives rise to fascinating effects and collective behaviour such as vortex creation and second sound. Using quantum gases in optical lattices, superfluids can be realized over a wide range of tunable parameters, with a continuous connection to the regime of strong correlation. However, for full experimental access and a comprehensive comparison with condensed-matter systems, there is a need for new detection techniques to probe their essential physics. Here we report on a comprehensive study of superfluids in optical lattices by Bragg spectroscopy. We present fully momentum-resolved measurements of the band structure and associated interaction effects at several lattice depths. In addition, we directly study the composition of excitations and observe strong indications for Bogoliubov backscattering. Our measurements demonstrate the applicability and limits of the Bogoliubov theory to describe excitation properties of superfluids in periodic potentials and should pave the way for detailed studies of strongly correlated phases.},

abstract = {ATUS-PRO is a solver-package written in C++ designed for the calculation of numerical solutions of the stationary- and the time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation for local two-particle contact interaction utilising finite element methods. These are implemented by means of the deal.II library (Bangerth et al., 0000) [1], (Bangerth et al., 2007) [2]. The code can be used in order to perform simulations of Bose-Einstein condensates in gravito-optical surface traps, isotropic and full anisotropic harmonic traps, as well as for arbitrary trap geometries. A special feature of this package is the possibility to calculate non-ground state solutions (topological modes, excited states) (Marojevi{\'{c}} et al., 2013), (Yukalov et al., 1997, 2004) [3,4] for an arbitrarily high non-linearity term. The solver-package is designed to run on parallel distributed machines and can be applied to problems in one, two, or three spatial dimensions with axial symmetry or in Cartesian coordinates. The time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved by means of the fully implicit Crank-Nicolson method, whereas stationary states are obtained with a modified version based on our own constrained Newton method (Marojevi{\'{c}} et al., 2013). The latter method enables to find the excited state solutions.},

Starting from the microscopic scattering properties of ultracold atoms, we derive the orbital exchange constants at 1/3 filling on the cubic optical lattice.

abstract = {Transport of fermions, particles with half-integer spin, is central to many fields of physics. Electron transport runs modern technology, defining states of matter such as superconductors and insulators, and electron spin is being explored as a new carrier of information. Neutrino transport energizes supernova explosions following the collapse of a dying star, and hydrodynamic transport of the quark-gluon plasma governed the expansion of the early Universe. However, our understanding of non-equilibrium dynamics in such strongly interacting fermionic matter is still limited. Ultracold gases of fermionic atoms realize a pristine model for such systems and can be studied in real time with the precision of atomic physics. Even above the superfluid transition, such gases flow as an almost perfect fluid with very low viscosity when interactions are tuned to a scattering resonance. In this hydrodynamic regime, collective density excitations are weakly damped. Here we experimentally investigate spin excitations in a Fermi gas of (6)Li atoms, finding that, in contrast, they are maximally damped. A spin current is induced by spatially separating two spin components and observing their evolution in an external trapping potential. We demonstrate that interactions can be strong enough to reverse spin currents, with components of opposite spin reflecting off each other. Near equilibrium, we obtain the spin drag coefficient, the spin diffusivity and the spin susceptibility as a function of temperature on resonance and show that they obey universal laws at high temperatures. In the degenerate regime, the spin diffusivity approaches a value set by [planck]/m, the quantum limit of diffusion, where [planck]/m is Planck's constant divided by 2{\$}\pi{\$} and m the atomic mass. For repulsive interactions, our measurements seem to exclude a metastable ferromagnetic state.},

This review illustrates theoretical concepts of both the particular nature of the highly excited Feshbach molecules produced and the techniques for their association from unbound atom pairs. Coupled channels theory provides the rigorous formulation of the microscopic physics of Feshbach resonances in cold gases. Concepts of dressed versus bare energy states, universal properties of Feshbach molecules, as well as the classification in terms of entrance- and closed-channel dominated resonances are introduced on the basis of practical two-channel approaches. Their significance is illustrated for several experimental observations, such as binding energies and lifetimes with respect to collisional relaxation. Molecular association and dissociation are discussed in the context of techniques involving linear magnetic field sweeps in cold Bose and Fermi gases as well as pulse sequences leading to Ramsey-type interference fringes. Their descriptions in terms of Landau-Zener, two-level mean field as well as beyond mean field approaches are reviewed in detail, including the associated ranges of validity.},

abstract = {In recent years extensive theoretical and experimental studies of universal few-body physics have advanced our understanding of universal Efimov physics. Whereas theory had been the driving force behind our understanding of Efimov physics for decades, recent experiments have contributed an unexpected discovery. Specifically, measurements have found that the so-called three-body parameter determining several properties of the system is universal, even though fundamental assumptions in the theory of the Efimov effect suggest that it should be a variable property that depends on the precise details of the short-range two- and three-body interactions. The present Letter resolves this apparent contradiction by elucidating previously unanticipated implications of the two-body interactions. Our study shows that the three-body parameter universality emerges because a universal effective barrier in the three-body potentials prevents the three particles from simultaneously getting close together. Our results also show limitations on this universality, as it is more likely to occur for neutral atoms but less likely to extend to light nuclei.},

temperatures by comparing simulations that treat the electrons as a fluid and simulations that
simultaneously include the electrons and ions. For light ions, the electron–ion scattering transfers
substantial energy from the electrons to the ions. Finally, we study the ion motion at early times

scales. This allows a test of electron–ion scattering when the electron plasma is nearly strongly

abstract = {The phase diagrams and phase transitions of bosons with short-ranged repulsive interactions moving in periodic and/or random external potentials at zero temperature are investigated with emphasis on the superfluid-insulator transition induced by varying a parameter such as the density. Bosons in periodic potentials (e.g., on a lattice) at T=0 exhibit two types of phases: a superfluid phase and Mott insulating phases characterized by integer (or commensurate) boson densities, by the existence of a gap for particle-hole excitations, and by zero compressibility. Generically, the superfluid onset transition in d dimensions from a Mott insulator to superfluidity is ‘‘ideal,'' or mean field in character, but at special multicritical points with particle-hole symmetry it is in the universality class of the (d+1)-dimensional XY model. In the presence of disorder, a third, ‘‘Bose glass'' phase exists. This phase is insulating because of the localization effects of the randomness and analogous to the Fermi glass phase of interacting fermions in a strongly disordered potential.},

abstract = {The realization of strong nonlinear interactions between individual light quanta (photons) is a long-standing goal in optical science and engineering, being of both fundamental and technological significance. In conventional optical materials, the nonlinearity at light powers corresponding to single photons is negligibly weak. Here we demonstrate a medium that is nonlinear at the level of individual quanta, exhibiting strong absorption of photon pairs while remaining transparent to single photons. The quantum nonlinearity is obtained by coherently coupling slowly propagating photons to strongly interacting atomic Rydberg states in a cold, dense atomic gas. Our approach paves the way for quantum-by-quantum control of light fields, including single-photon switching, all-optical deterministic quantum logic and the realization of strongly correlated many-body states of light.},

abstract = {We study the use of an optical Feshbach resonance to modify the p-wave interaction between ultracold polarized 171Yb spin-1/2 fermions. A laser exciting two colliding atoms to the 1S0+3P1 channel can be detuned near a purely-long-range excited molecular bound state. Such an exotic molecule has an inner turning point far from the chemical binding region, and thus, three-body recombination in the Feshbach resonance will be highly suppressed in contrast to that typically seen in a ground-state p-wave magnetic Feshbach resonance. We calculate the excited molecular bound-state spectrum using a multichannel integration of the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, including an external perturbation by a magnetic field. From the multichannel wave functions, we calculate the Feshbach resonance properties, including the modification of the elastic p-wave scattering volume and inelastic spontaneous scattering rate. The use of magnetic fields and selection rules for polarized light yields a highly controllable system. We apply this control to propose a toy model for three-color superfluidity in an optical lattice for spin-polarized 171Yb, where the three colors correspond to the three spatial orbitals of the first excited p band. We calculate the conditions under which tunneling and on-site interactions are comparable, at which point quantum critical behavior is possible.},

Employing projective (zero temperature) quantum Monte Carlo simulations for even values of N, we explore the evolution from a weak-coupling semimetal into the strong-coupling, insulating regime. Furthermore, we compare our numerical results to a saddle-point approximation in the large-N limit. From the large-N regime down to the SU(6) case, the insulating state is found to be a columnar valence bond crystal, with a direct transition to the semimetal at weak, finite coupling, in agreement with the mean-field result in the large-N limit. At SU(4) however, the insulator exhibits a subtly different valence bond crystal structure, stabilized by resonating valence bond plaquettes. In the SU(2) limit, our results support a direct transition between the semimetal and an antiferromagnetic insulator.},

In this case the spectral structure of the Rydberg atom is completely determined by an effective potential which depends on the density distribution of the condensate.

In the frequency domain, we observe a mean-field shift of the Rydberg state which results in intrinsic optical bistability above a critical Rydberg number density. In the time domain, we observe critical slowing down where the recovery time to system perturbations diverges with critical exponent {\$}\alpha{\$}=-0.53±0.10.

We study the evolution of the Lieb-Liniger model, a gas of interacting bosons moving on the continuous infinite line and interacting via a short range potential. The formalism allows us to quench the system from any initial state. We find that for any value of repulsive coupling independently of the initial state the system asymptotes towards a strongly repulsive gas, while for any value of attractive coupling, the system forms a maximal bound state that dominates at longer times. In either case the system equilibrates but does not thermalize. We compare this to quenches in a Bose-Hubbard lattice and show that there, initial states determine long-time dynamics independent of the sign of the coupling.},

abstract = {Optical Feshbach resonances (OFRs) have generated significant experimental interest in recent years. These resonances are promising for many-body physics experiments, yet the practical application of OFRs has been limited. The theory of OFRs has been based on an approximate model that fails in important detuning regimes, and the incomplete theoretical understanding of this effect has hindered OFR experiments. We present the most complete theoretical treatment of OFRs to date, demonstrating important characteristics that must be considered in OFR experiments and comparing OFRs to the well-studied case of magnetic Feshbach resonances. We also present a comprehensive treatment of the approximate OFR model, including a study of the range of validity for this model. Finally, we derive experimentally useful expressions that can be applied to real experimental data to extract important information about the resonance structure of colliding atoms.},
annote = {Yellow - references
Purple - Important approximations or limitations

Useful paper for starting to understand OFR. Main result seems to be that a CC calculation imposes a near resonance limit to doing OFR and that this full calc agrees with isolated resonance theory far away. Have some very nice experimentally viable formulas towards the end that could prove useful for looking at PA loss from a trap.},

Using the time-evolving block decimation method, we numerically calculate the tunneling splitting of two macroscopically distinct states with different winding numbers. From the scaling of the tunneling splitting with respect to the system size, we determine the critical point of the superfluid to Mott insulator transition for arbitrary integer filling factors. We find that the critical values versus the filling factor in 1D, 2D, and 3D are well approximated by a simple analytical function.

abstract = {In a solid material strong interactions between the electrons can lead to surprising properties. A prime example is the Mott insulator, where the suppression of conductivity is a result of interactions and not the consequence of a filled Bloch band. The proximity to the Mott insulating phase in fermionic systems is the origin for many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics, most notably high-temperature superconductivity. Therefore it is highly desirable to use the novel experimental tools developed in atomic physics to access this regime. Indeed, the Hubbard model, which encompasses the essential physics of the Mott insulator, also applies to quantum gases trapped in an optical lattice. However, the Mott insulating regime has so far been reached only with a gas of bosons, lacking the rich and peculiar nature of fermions. Here we report on the formation of a Mott insulator of a repulsively interacting two-component Fermi gas in an optical lattice. It is signalled by three features: a drastic suppression of doubly occupied lattice sites, a strong reduction of the compressibility inferred from the response of double occupancy to atom number increase, and the appearance of a gapped mode in the excitation spectrum. Direct control of the interaction strength allows us to compare the Mott insulating and the non-interacting regime without changing tunnel-coupling or confinement. Our results pave the way for further studies of the Mott insulator, including spin ordering and ultimately the question of d-wave superfluidity.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} EM International. In this paper, we reported a method to detect the presence of Pb and Cu in aquatic environment using two types of photosynthetic pigments in cyanobacteria Anabaena cylindrica (Wong) chlorophylls and carotenoids as reporters. The detection was based on the reduction of chlorophylls and carotenoids in the presence of the heavy metals, while the changes were captured using spectrophotometer with {\"{e}} = 440 nm and 640 nm respectively. Using cells from lag phase and the exposure time of 24 hours, the changes of both pigments were recorded after the cells were exposed to 0.01 mg/L, 0.10 mg/L, 1.00 mg/L, and 10.00 mg/L of Pb and Cu respectively. The results showed the optical densities (OD) which are corresponding to the concentration of chlorophylls and carotenoids in cyanobacteria were well-correlated to the change of heavy metals concentrations. Then, we demonstrated that the correlation between the concentration changes of the pigments to heavy metals and the sensitivity of the detection could be enhanced with simple modelling. Thus, we concluded that both chlorophyll and carotenoids in A. cylindrica could be used as bio-reporters for Pb and Cu detection, while modelling of the responses could be an alternative to enhance the sensitivity of the detection.},

Reaching this regime has usually required both strong elastic and weak inelastic interactions, as the latter produce losses. We show that strong inelastic collisions can actually inhibit particle losses and drive a system into a strongly-correlated regime. Studying the dynamics of ultracold molecules in an optical lattice confined to one dimension, we show that the particle loss rate is reduced by a factor of 10. Adding a lattice along the one dimension increases the reduction to a factor of 2000.

abstract = {New results concerning the mathematical properties of the Fokker–Planck equation describing the electron distribution function are presented. The validity of the approximations obtained by using a finite number of Legendre polynomials to describe the electron distribution function is discussed. It is shown that, due to the Landau form of the electron‐ion collision operator, it is sufficient to use two or three Legendre polynomials in problems of interest. The theory is applied to the classical albedo problem as a test, and is also applied to determine the distribution and the heat flux in a heat front typical of laser plasma experiments. It is shown that the heat flux can be expressed as a sort of convolution of the Spitzer–H{\"{a}}rm heat flux by a delocalization function. The convolution formula leads in a physically relevant way to the saturation and the delocalization of the heat flux.},

Comparison between the predictions of the new models and those of previous empirical and $\backslash$emph{\{}ab initio{\}} studies reveals good agreement with most series, however some discrepancies are highlighted. Using the multichannel quantum defect theory wave functions derived from our models we calculate other observables such as Land$\backslash$'e {\$}g{\_}J{\$}-factors and radiative lifetimes. The analysis reveals the impact of perturbers on the Rydberg state properties of divalent atoms, highlighting the importance of including two-electron effects in the calculations of these properties.

At shock coalescence, we observed rapid heating to temperatures of 25,000 kelvin when the scattering spectra show the collective plasmon oscillations that indicate the transition to the dense metallic plasma state. The plasmon frequency determines the material compression, which is found to be a factor of 3, thereby reaching conditions in the laboratory relevant for studying the physics of planetary formation.},

It is argued that probabilities like this which pertain to continuous monitoring possess operational meaning. A simple natural approach to this problem leads to the conclusion that an unstable particle which is continuously observed to see whether it decays will never be found to decay!. Since recording the track of an unstable particle (which can be distinguished from its decay products) approximately realizes such continuous observations, the above conclusion seems to pose a paradox which we call Zeno's paradox in quantum theory. The relation of this result to that of some previous works and its implications and possible resolutions are briefly discussed. The mathematical transcription of the above‐mentioned conclusion is a structure theorem concerning semigroups. Although special cases of this theorem are known, the general formulation and the proof given here are believed to be new. We also note that the known ''no‐go'' theorem concerning the semigroup law for the reduced evolution of any physical system (including decaying systems) is subsumed under our theorem as a direct corollary.},

Both helium and neon buffer gas sources are shown to produce ThO beams with high flux, low divergence, low forward velocity, and cold internal temperature for a variety of stagnation densities and nozzle diameters. The beam operates with a buffer gas stagnation density of {\~{}}10{\^{}}15-10{\^{}}16 cm{\^{}}-3 (Reynolds number {\~{}}1-100), resulting in expansion cooling of the internal temperature of the ThO to as low as 2 K.

These sources deliver {\~{}}10{\^{}}11 ThO molecules in a single quantum state within a 1-3 ms long pulse at 10 Hz repetition rate. Under conditions optimized for a future precision spectroscopy application [A C Vutha et al 2010 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt.

Compared to typical supersonic sources, the relatively low stagnation density of this source, and the fact that the cooling mechanism relies only on collisions with an inert buffer gas, make it widely applicable to many atomic and molecular species, including those which are chemically reactive, such as ThO.},

abstract = {We use Rabi spectroscopy to explore the low-energy excitation spectrum of a finite-temperature Bose gas of rubidium atoms across the phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). To record this spectrum, we coherently drive the atomic population between two spin states. A small relative displacement of the spin-specific trapping potentials enables sideband transitions between different motional states. The intrinsic non-linearity of the motional spectrum, mainly originating from two-body interactions, makes it possible to resolve and address individual excitation lines. Together with sensitive atom-counting, this constitutes a feasible technique to count single excited atoms of a BEC and to determine the temperature of nearly pure condensates. As an example, we show that for a nearly pure BEC of N = 800 atoms the first excited state has a population of less than 5 atoms, corresponding to an upper bound on the temperature of 30 nK.},

We employ a high-temperature expansion that is accurate when the temperature is larger than the tunneling rate, similar to current regimes in ultracold atom experiments. In addition to exploring the Mott insulator-metal crossover, we calculate final temperatures achieved by the standard experimental protocol of adiabatically ramping from a noninteracting gas, as a function of initial gas temperature. Of particular experimental interest, we find that increasing N for fixed particle numbers and initial temperatures gives substantially colder Mott insulators after the adiabatic ramping, up to more than a factor of 5 for relevant parameters. This cooling happens for all N, fixing the initial entropy, or for all N≲20 (the exact value depends on dimensionality), at fixed, experimentally relevant initial temperatures.},

abstract = {It is a fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics that a closed system with many degrees of freedom ergodically samples all equal energy points in phase space. To understand the limits of this assumption, it is important to find and study systems that are not ergodic, and thus do not reach thermal equilibrium. A few complex systems have been proposed that are expected not to thermalize because their dynamics are integrable. Some nearly integrable systems of many particles have been studied numerically, and shown not to ergodically sample phase space. However, there has been no experimental demonstration of such a system with many degrees of freedom that does not approach thermal equilibrium. Here we report the preparation of out-of-equilibrium arrays of trapped one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases, each containing from 40 to 250 (87)Rb atoms, which do not noticeably equilibrate even after thousands of collisions. Our results are probably explainable by the well-known fact that a homogeneous 1D Bose gas with point-like collisional interactions is integrable. Until now, however, the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium 1D Bose gases has been a theoretically unsettled issue, as practical factors such as harmonic trapping and imperfectly point-like interactions may compromise integrability. The absence of damping in 1D Bose gases may lead to potential applications in force sensing and atom interferometry.},

abstract = {Quantum many-body systems can have phase transitions even at zero temperature; fluctuations arising from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, as opposed to thermal effects, drive the system from one phase to another. Typically, during the transition the relative strength of two competing terms in the system's Hamiltonian changes across a finite critical value. A well-known example is the Mott-Hubbard quantum phase transition from a superfluid to an insulating phase, which has been observed for weakly interacting bosonic atomic gases. However, for strongly interacting quantum systems confined to lower-dimensional geometry, a novel type of quantum phase transition may be induced and driven by an arbitrarily weak perturbation to the Hamiltonian. Here we observe such an effect--the sine-Gordon quantum phase transition from a superfluid Luttinger liquid to a Mott insulator--in a one-dimensional quantum gas of bosonic caesium atoms with tunable interactions. For sufficiently strong interactions, the transition is induced by adding an arbitrarily weak optical lattice commensurate with the atomic granularity, which leads to immediate pinning of the atoms. We map out the phase diagram and find that our measurements in the strongly interacting regime agree well with a quantum field description based on the exactly solvable sine-Gordon model. We trace the phase boundary all the way to the weakly interacting regime, where we find good agreement with the predictions of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Our results open up the experimental study of quantum phase transitions, criticality and transport phenomena beyond Hubbard-type models in the context of ultracold gases.},

We contrast the relaxation dynamics of this class of systems with those evolving via classical rate equations towards a stationary state with the same values of diagonal or "classical" observables as in the quantum system but where coherences are absent. We focus in particular on spin systems whose dynamics becomes correlated and complex due to dynamical constraints, inspired by kinetically constrained models (KCMs) of classical glasses. We show that in the quantum case the relaxation of the coherences can be orders of magnitude slower than that of diagonal observables. Finally, we show that the relaxation of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions can indeed, in an appropriate limit, be described by such a purely dissipative dynamics with non-classical jump operators.

We find that for sufficiently weak pulses, the usual analytical short-pulse prediction for the Raman-Nath regime continues to hold for longer times, albeit with a reduction of the apparent modulation depth of the standing wave. We quantitatively relate this effect to the Fourier width of the pulse, and draw analogies to the Rabi dynamics of a coupled two-state system. Our findings, combined with numerical modeling for stronger pulses, are of practical interest for the calibration of optical lattices in ultracold atomic systems.},

Analytical results for the ground state energy, critical fields and complete phase diagrams are presented for weak and strong regimes. Numerical solutions of the dressed energy equations allow us to examine how the different phase boundaries modify by varying the inter-component coupling throughout the whole attractive regimes. The pure trionic phase reduces smoothly by decreasing this coupling until the weak limit is reached. In this weak regime, a pure BCS-paired phase can be sustained under certain nonlinear Zeeman splittings. Finally we confirm that the analytic expressions for the physical quantities and resulting phase diagrams are highly accurate in the weak and strong coupling regimes.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, establishment and adaptation of cell-based assays for drug development and testing has become an important topic in high-throughput screening (HTS). Most new assays are designed to rapidly detect specific cellular effects reflecting action at various targets. However, although more complex than cell-free biochemical test systems, HTS assays using monolayer or suspension cultures still reflect a highly artificial cellular environment and may thus have limited predictive value for the clinical efficacy of a compound. Today's strategies for drug discovery and development, be they hypothesis free or mechanism based, require facile, HTS-amenable test systems that mimic the human tissue environment with increasing accuracy in order to optimize preclinical and preanimal selection of the most active molecules from a large pool of potential effectors, for example, against solid tumors. Indeed, it is recognized that 3-dimensional cell culture systems better reflect the in vivo behavior of most cell types. However, these 3-D test systems have not yet been incorporated into mainstream drug development operations. This article addresses the relevance and potential of 3-D in vitro systems for drug development, with a focus on screening for novel antitumor drugs. Examples of 3-D cell models used in cancer research are given, and the advantages and limitations of these systems of intermediate complexity are discussed in comparison with both 2-D culture and in vivo models. The most commonly used 3-D cell culture systems, multicellular spheroids, are emphasized due to their advantages and potential for rapid development as HTS systems. Thus, multicellular tumor spheroids are an ideal basis for the next step in creating HTS assays, which are predictive of in vivo antitumor efficacy.},

abstract = {The "smoking gun" of small-scale, impulsive events heating the solar corona is expected to be the presence of hot ({\textgreater}5 MK) plasma. Evidence for this has been scarce, but has gradually begun to accumulate due to recent studies designed to constrain the high-temperature part of the emission measure distribution. However, the detected hot component is often weaker than models predict and this is due in part to the common modeling assumption that the ionization balance remains in equilibrium. The launch of the latest generation of space-based observing instrumentation on board Hinode and the Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO ) has brought the matter of the ionization state of the plasma firmly to the forefront. It is timely to consider exactly what emission current instruments would detect when observing a corona heated impulsively on small scales by nanoflares. Only after we understand the full effects of nonequilibrium ionization can we draw meaningful conclusions about the plasma that is (or is not) present. We have therefore performed a series of hydrodynamic simulations for a variety of different nanoflare properties and initial conditions. Our study has led to several key conclusions. (1) Deviations from equilibrium are greatest for short-duration nanoflares at low initial coronal densities. (2) Hot emission lines are the most affected and are suppressed sometimes to the point of being invisible. (3) For the many scenarios we have considered, the emission detected in several of the SDO -AIA channels (131, 193, and 211 {\AA}) would be dominated by warm, overdense, cooling plasma. (4) It is difficult not to create coronal loops that emit strongly at 1.5 MK and in the range 2-6 MK, which are the most commonly observed kind, for a broad range of nanoflare scenarios. (5) The Fe XV (284.16 {\AA}) emission in most of our models is about 10 times brighter than the Ca XVII (192.82 {\AA}) emission, consistent with observations. Our overarching conclusion is that small-scale, impulsive heating inducing a nonequilibrium ionization state leads to predictions for observable quantities that are entirely consistent with what is actually observed.},

Vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field induce a dipole moment in each molecule and these induced moments interact via the retarded potential that is appropriate for resonant coupling. The dispersion potential is the sum over the field modes of the product of this potential and the second-order spatial correlation function of the electromagnetic field. This gives the familiar Casimir-Polder potential an an integral over imaginary frequencies. An extension to obtain the interaction energy between one molecule in its ground state and another in an excited state is outlined.},

A theoretical model developed for the interaction of intense femtosecond laser pulses with solid targets on the basis of the two-temperature equation of state for an irradiated substance allows the description of the dynamics of the formation and scattering of the plasma. Comparison of the experimental data with the simulation results provides new information on the transport coefficients and absorption capacity of the nonideal plasma.},

abstract = {Coherent preparation by laser light of quantum states of atoms and molecules can lead to quantum interference in the amplitudes of optical transitions. In this way the optical properties of a medium can be dramatically modified, leading to electromagnetically induced transparency and related effects, which have placed gas-phase systems at the center of recent advances in the development of media with radically new optical properties. This article reviews these advances and the new possibilities they offer for nonlinear optics and quantum information science. As a basis for the theory of electromagnetically induced transparency the authors consider the atomic dynamics and the optical response of the medium to a continuous-wave laser. They then discuss pulse propagation and the adiabatic evolution of field-coupled states and show how coherently prepared media can be used to improve frequency conversion in nonlinear optical mixing experiments. The extension of these concepts to very weak optical fields in the few-photon limit is then examined. The review concludes with a discussion of future prospects and potential new applications.},

Lett. 107, 275301 (2011)] a method for simulating compact Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) using Bose-Einstein condensates has been suggested. We suggest an alternative approach, which relies on single atoms in an optical lattice, carrying 2l+1 internal levels, which converges rapidly to cQED as l increases. That enables the simulation of cQED in both the weak and the strong coupling regimes, hence allowing to probe confinement as well as other nonperturbative effects of the theory. We provide an explicit construction for the case l=1 which is sufficient for simulating the effect of confinement between two external static charges.},

We measured the three-body recombination rate constants for condensates and cold noncondensates from number loss in the F = 1,m(f) = -1 hyperfine state of Rb-87. The ratio of these is 7.4(2.6) which agrees with the theoretical factor of 3! and demonstrates that condensate atoms are less bunched than noncondensate atoms.},
