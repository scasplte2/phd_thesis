two things I want to do

I need a brief overview of low energy scattering to motivate the scattering wavefunction

solution of the square step as a way to connect the classical statistical mechanics of a dilute gas to the quantum mechanical scattering-based solution to the lineshapes

oh myu friggin lord I havbe been struggling with this for such a long time. Why can't I just get y thoughts together? It is so infuriating.
what is the conclusion I want to have at the end of chapter three?
I want the reader to know that PA dis concerning the scattering wavefunction, that it comes from the overlap integral of the tweo wavefunctions (why do I need to know this? nbecause this means that it is sensitive to positions of the nodes and can be used to map out the potentials

lshort summary of my chapter three conclision
pa depends on the interatomic potential and the energy of the constituent atoms

chapter three is where I need to introduce K with the simple version of f(p_

what about writing K witht the center of mass frame?
	that is a comploication I can figure out later
	
	what is the organization of chapter three?
	intro - what can PA be used for? what is it's general purpose, why not just follow the model of the friggin jones review here
	
	vaguelyu talk abotut PA and how it works and give a sim[ple picture but don't discuss any of the phjysics
	
	ok so I want something like
	intro
	theoreitcal description
		basic scattering
		modifying interactions aka field dressed theory
		connect that to the PA model
		
		what is my segfue from the full quantum treatment to the closed analytic forms? - this is the BJ argument
		
		I am so tired of sitting here struggling with this. I am foinf rto fet this done. I will not fail. I WILL NOT FAIL at this. FUCK
		
		I want to incorporate the descriptthe ideal description
		
		that is what I want chapter three to be, it needs to be the ideal simple description of all these processes so that I can make them more complicated later in 4 and 5
		
		ok, so move the experimental details to chapter 4 for sure.
		
		how do I organize the rest of the chapter?
		
		umm.....
		
		how to connect the has description in the trap to the pa process?	
		
		ok, so develpo the simple theory showing the contributions from the different thermal energies
		
		Realizing photoassociation using ultracold fases?
		
		j,,..... dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd

Collisional wavefunction notes
###			
consider the two particle system as a single entagled particle
	long range part of this quasi-particle is just the eigenstates of the separate particles themselves (only composed of two parts)
	but the short range part is going to be determined by some complex physics (new eigenstates, what is the coupling mechanism?)
		the vdW point is the boundary distance?
		coupling is due to the interatomic potential, there is at least the long-range part falling off as R6, what are the types of interactions which make up the internal wall?


Think I want to introduce the photoassocation by talking about the collisional wavefunction

what will that do?

I want to build up ideas about the FCF and need the wf for that
	to get qf I have to go back to scattering theory

ideas of the wavefunction become that basis for how you want to talk about interacting potentials


free atoms
scatering as single particle state (differnet eigenstate)
	interaction determined by some gnarly stuff
From scattering theory we know that the long range behavior is determined by short range physics
	how do we know this? (the dalibard intro)
Can we come up with good enough pseudo potentials to describe the short range physics and then solve the schrodinger equation to extract wavefunctions?
	we want wavefunctions because that is the full characterization
	we don't know the right eigenbasis for the short range part but we can make some guesses (in particular Hund cases setup eigen states for various possible internal states)
	Bohn and Julienne theory guessed based on using quantum defect theory
		this pre-supposes that the bound and free wavefunctions are similar (I forget in what respect) but that the bound ones must go to zero as R->Inf
If we have some notion of the wf then we can construct matricies which define interactions once we add additional coupling to the scattering problem


now in a position where I need to connect scattering theory and the PAS


Once we have the ground state wavefunction of our new particle we can construct the internal structure by considering the internal energy strucutrue of the constituent atoms
	Can I make a connnection that since it is a composite particle we must consider all the various configurations available?

2019.03.14
--------------------------------
I was trying to figure out what subsections to use for introducing the experimental methods section in ch 4. 
Keys pooints to make are that we used our apparatus mostly but for the low intensity halo 
I think I would like to discus

lets see I will have already discussed the neutral apparatus and in this part I just need to talk about the AOM setup and the frequency stuff
	basically figure 2 from the paper
So.   uhhhhh
	We used this same setup on the rudnerh apparatus. The biggest difference was the optical dipole trap was a single beam trap instead of our normal crossed trap. This did leave to differences in the density and thermalization and so on
	
	Ok so present the PA setup and the basic sequence then talk about the trap
	
	
	
	progression would be like
	sequence
	
	no no
	
	rather,

	
	
Ch. 4
Progression
-------------------------------------------------------------	
Ecperimental methods
	expeeriments in this chapter adn the following are very similar. biggest scientific differnece is that we explored different regimes of intensity
	experiments in this chapter were done on rydberg apparatus
		nearly identical machine to ours 
			sample prep is the same but they have different ODT configurations
			specifics of general trapping procedure and characteristics can be found in some location
		used the PA light from my apparatus coupled through a long fiber
			pa generation talked abot below
		For the low E exp the general parameters were such and such
	generic timinf diagram (denote where physics is different)
generation of photoassociation light
Specifics of the low e experiment
	discuss optical setup
		propagation, polarization
	B field?
	ODT configurartion
		consideration of the trap depth
			during experiment we took a lot of data over a wide range of parameters and asumed we were in a deeply trapped regime
				took data all the way down at 30nK and thought it was normal to not have a BEC at this point because it is 86
			determined trap frequencies after we did the experiment
			during analysis we found a problem with the model not agreeing
				30nK data did not fit well if we made the typical assumptions about a deep trap
				show plot of fit
			decided to model the trap numerically
				trap frequencies were measured at higher temps and extrapolated using model (reason to believe modeling)
			modeling found that the lowest point of the trap was an odd trajectory and was much lower than we naively thought
				show plot of fit
				hypothesized that the sample may not have been thermalized completely (non-ergodic) and thus was fooling us
				this is supported by the better fitting of 30 nK data over time
			Brings into questions the use of temperature, but will persist with that data where there is at least reaonsable agreement
			Leads to a strong modification of the momentum distribution and will effect the energy integral due to large variation in the available energy range

Questions

FORM OF INTERACTION POTENTIAL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	
Not sure where to get the isotropy from
	there is some description of this in sakurai and I think Hutson discusses it as well
	
What is that picture in Jones about reflection? I assumed reflection was because the result of the overlap integral "reflected" the stucture of the wavefunction so you could figure out the ground state wavefunction by coupling to various condon points and seeing the change in amplitude
	That picture has reflections from the inner wall though. Maybe he is trying to get at the fact that the wavefunction itself is due to interference of the incoming and outgoing waves bouncing off?
	- I think the part I was missing here is that he is probably illustrating higher order partial waves as reflecting at different point since this is also part of the interference (all incoming and outgoing waves interfere)	
	
Still unsure exactly what the Born approximation is other than assuming a single scattering event
	basically say that we're only concerned about two-body collisions
	maybe that is what is meant by BO potential, the potential formed between two atoms and not more
		What would that look like?
	- answer is in the burke thesis, 2.2.1 I think
	
I slightly recall that the condon point is not actually defined to be the outer turning point. It just tends to overlap with it.
	Is the condon point then the most probable distance between the constituent atoms of a diatomic molecule, or something else?
	- answered in Blatt thesis, it is the point the potentials cross. How come we talk about the outer turning point then?
	
Simple model with interaction of a single BO potential
What is a BO potential? The BO approx was to say that single scattering matters right? Where does the isotropy come in? Are these related?
- Burke thesis 2.2.1, I think. Isotropy is not a part of this. 
	BO potential comes from averaging over the electron dynamics. Essentially, put atoms at a fixed distance apart and see what the potential energy does due to electron cloud overlap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^		
		
COUPLING MECHANISM FOR RESONANCE SCATTERING
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	
What is the coupling mechanism for say a shape resonance? 
	the multiple channels all must interact somehow
	- I think this is just the short range coupling stuff. The closed channel exists at short range and even tiny coupling between the eigenstates can change the long-range scattering properties due to the background scattering length representing the entirety of the inner well
	- also, I think it is the wavefuntions mixing that shift the eigenenergies of the bare wavefunctions. This is why BJ approach works to take WKB like wavefunctions for closed channel and use them to couple with long range scattering wfs (with boundary conditions). Resulting in a manageable form of the K matrix
	
So is this coriolis mixing and other stuff just didn't types of couplings between bare eigenstates?
	god dammit, it must be
	What are all the types of mixing that we have found?
	I'll settle for physical interpretation of the mixings we know about for strontium
	- Coriolis mixing is electronic and nuclear (rovibrational) dynamics (LJ coupling, I think this is molecule orbital angular momentum L and J?), also zeeman effects from LS (electronic orbital and spin angular momenta) \cite{McGuyer2013}
	- so you have a new type of hyperfine coupling in the molecule because of the combined electron clouds interacting with the combined nucleus. Also new zeeman shift for the composite electron and nucleus \cite{Stoof1988}
	- Coriolis coupling, i.e. a coupling between the vibration and rotation of a molecule, mcdonald thesis	
	
How does the energy of the scattering state come into play with shape resonances?
	I bet that the energy of open channel is defined by the temperature of the atoms.
	This is why you can have a shape resonance at certain temperatures.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^		
	
SCATTERING LENGTH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^		
Is it correct to say that the canonical scattering length isn't actually useful to be interpreted as a physical length?
	- It doesn't define any physical length scale that is of consequence to the atoms. 
	- Remember that it does define a length scale relevant to scattering though because it defines the cross-section
		- This is why I would call it a scattering length
	- To better illustrate this, consider the (call it condon point for now), there is a physical interpretation of this length scale as the most probable distance between the constituents of a diatomic molecule. However, this point in the collisional wavefunction of two atoms is given by aBar 

aBar must be defined as the probability at zero energy right?
	because the wavefunction changes as a function of energy
	
oh wait, maybe aBar is the distinguishing point between long-range and short-range?
	what is the difference in aBar and avdW?

So then what is the physical interpretation of a? Is there one? Why do we represent the phase shift in terms of a length then?
	I think the answer here is that it gives a nice easy formula for the mean field energy in a degenerate gas.
	I hope there is a better answer.
	Can a somehow be thought of as a coupling strength between degenerate particles?
	
If the above bit is true, it makes it really easy to introduce the optical length as just a length scale unit that describes the coupling strength between open and closed channels.
	We choose a length scale representation though because there is an easy physical interpretation in terms of changing the elastic scattering length
	
What is the physical interpretation of a?

What is the physical interpretation of cross section?
	gives likelihood of particles colliding?
	I'm missing something dumb here
	
What then is the origin of the unitarity limit?
	- Energy is so high that all the particles see is the delta function at 0!!! fucking A, why am I so dumb. I can't believe I never got that, bahh.
	Hot damn
	So the limits of cross section are the unitarity limit at incoming energy high enough that the particles only see a delta function and the zero energy scattering length due to the phase shift of the molecular potential.
	
Gribakin and Flambaum showed that is V(r) behaves at long range as V(r) = C_n/r^n, the zero-energy scattering length is given semiclasically by 1.29
1.30 - Mean scattering length
Physical interpretation of this?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	

THEORETICAL APPROACH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Is the generic quantum approach the same for any two particles of similar mass?
	I mean, solving the SE is but I guess I mean do all scattered particles break down into the
		1. plane wave + spherical wave asymptotoe
		2. pick a basis set and expand the asymp form
		3. Get the SE in terms of basis set and solve making sure to connect to asymptotic form?
		4. Rinse repeat
	This is basically the algorithm for solving a time-independent quantum problem so it must be the same
		boundary conditions, basis set, potential in terms of basis set, solve SE

How do you connect the idea of scattering to resonance?
	I thought the MFR resonance looked different than PA resonances but they have to come from the same thing
	I mean, embedding a level is embedding a level. hmm
	I don't think this is correct but maybe the S matrix defines a flux hmm... cross sections
	cross-section is rate loss constant times relative velocity and K is defined in terms of S. 
	S is the scattering matrix in multi-channel, so does it somehow define the phase shift for each channel?
		what then are the off diagonal terms in S? Are they couplings of some sort?
		what are the off diagonal terms in K?

should I discuss the formulas in the isolated resonance model from nicholson or like how bohn and julienne derived them?

Where to put in that PA can help map out the ground state potential through reflection approximation

CM ch 6
how is S motivated? Maybe Mies discusses it
	oh, I think Julienne said it in CM. 
	- The S-matrix is the generalization of the phase shift relation across all the channels. It is what is needed to understand the interactions because the interactions lead to coupling phase shifts which will change the cross section!!!

		we don't necessarily know what the details of the inner potential are
physical interpretation of variation of scattering length
	this is the zero energy limit
connection to bound states

somewhere want to give the limits of the cross sections as difference between unitarity and zero-energy scattering

Multi-channel extension apparent once you add internal structure (or the particles are really atoms)
	here is where I call the above the single channel theory and describe why
		namely that the atoms in the ground state represent a single channel out of the many possible internal configurations of the constituent atoms
	still have all the consequences from single-channel theory but now with lots of other potentials around as well
this would be the end of the story if all of these potentials were "separable" (or independent)
	you'd find your configuration, describe the potential, solve it, and you're done
of course this isn't actually the case because the eigenstates of the separate potentials couple to one another.
Even understanding the natural coupling between coupling between potentials is not easy
	tie back to complexity of understanding short range physics
		We don't really know what coupling exist and which energy levels are most important
	mostly effects the bound states of the system
	strontium example of the D state coupling in the 3P1 potential
		references to Res and other work
huge simplifying thing in cold AMO, we mostly care about the the long-range wavefunctions 
	which are mostly determined by the leading order term for how the potential falls off at infinity with an added phase shift
	the phase shift is what gives us the scattering length
		it is the phase shift that is the important bit! 
Possible discussion about phase shift in terms of length

define open and close channel somewhere

address somewhere that these types of problems are generally solved via coupled-channel methods which follow the same recipe for the scattering problem as in the single channel case but does so considering all channels simultaneously through matricies defining potentials and their couplings to one another.

Remember that the phase shift encapsulates all the information of the inner potential and is very sensitive
	this was shown in the above sections (?)
Additionally, these potentials are effected by couplings to other potentials.
	Mixing of potentials is determined by how far apart in energy the potentials are and how strong the coupling between them is
	some reference like landau-zener or something?
So what if we could change the relative energy spacing between potentials?
	This could lead to mixing of potentials and perturb the phase shift that gives us the scattering length
this is the origin of scattering resonances in ultracold atoms and can provide a rigorous theoretical description of photoassociation

scattering resonances are due to off diagonal coupling between bound closed channels and scattering open channels
	give picture
hand wavy expalanation is that bringing a bound state close will modify the open channel (potential?)
	this results in a tweak of the phase shift which results in a change in scattering length
can describe this as a change in the elastic cross section of the incoming open channel
in general there is also an inelastic cross section that may contribute if the bound state has a finite lifetime.

somehow need to introduce the complex scattering length here to acount for the elastic and inelastic parts
	
Most common example of scattering resonance is MFR in alkali atoms
	other potentials are due to different combinations of atoms in hyperfine states
	these potentials can have different magnetic moments
		means that addition of a magnetic field can tune them relative to one another
MFR has been extensively studied and is a common tool used in atomic physics

While MFR is most common, resonance scattering is also the cause for shape resonances due to centrifugal barriers
	when the incoming energy in the open channel happens to line up with a quasi-bound state at E>0

Though the details of these phenomena are slightly different they are both due to wavefunctions in open channels being modified by bound states in closed ones.
	- There is another subtle similarity though, as the energy difference of these two processes are also similar.
	- The energy splitting between various hyperfine configurations of MFR's is typically BLAH and shape resonances are generally most important at energies below 1K as scattering cross sections move away from the unitarity limit

How then can resonace scattering describe photoassociation when the optical potentials are TeV (how many K?) apart?
	The answer is to consider the process in a field-dressed basis, where the quantum state of the photon field and two-particle wavefunction are considered as one.
		Side note: In the context of a single atom's internal structure being combined with a photon field, this idea is known as the dressed atom model. We specifically choose to distinguish this approach in the two-particle scattering context by referring to it as a field dressed approach.
With this new picture, we can essentially follow the theoretical recipe pioneered by magnetic feshbach resonances and define their optical analogs.
There is one big difference between MFR's and OFR's though and that is that most common MFR's utilize bound states with extremely long lifetimes. 
	This means that the inelastic contribution to the complex scattering length is neglibile.
In OFR's however, the closed channel bound state is a from a potential with a finite lifetime.
	This can lead to significant loss and heating of the gas as photons are absorbed and emitted by the colliding atoms and energy is pumped into the system.
This property practically precludes such OFR's from working in alkali metal systems since the most accessible transitions are very wide and have short lifetimes. Although, fast detection processes did allow for the first observation of OFR's to occur in a Rb BEC.

Alkaline earth atoms, such as Sr, were hypothesized to take advantage of OFR's since there is a narrow transition easily accessible which could provide large changes in the elastic cross section while minimizing the losses due to the inelastic contribution. This was thought to be possible by controllable detuning the closed channel from the incoming open channel and balancing the loss rate (check this). While there were observations of a strontium OFR, notably work done on this very apparatus (citations), they were accompanied by unexpectedly high loss rates. Recent work by Nicholson et. al. were able to explain some of this behavior through a quantum interference effect whereby the elastic loss rate returns to zero between bound states as the effects of bound states cancel each other out. They used a coupled-channel description to describe the physics.
	I want to clean up the wording there a little
	
A consequence of this coupled channel model is the reproduction of the seminal relations describing photoassociation when the coupled-channel model is simplified by assuming close proximity to a single resonance.

Not sure how easy it is to tie BJ and Nicholson together. If I can do it in a couple sentences I will.

----------------------
PA on narrow lines

quick note on the usage of the relative momentum distribution
usually this is all we care about since the CoM part results in doppler shifts which would be neglible on the energy scales of broad dipole-allowed transtions
using narrow intercombinations lines, the photon recoil energy is comparable to the bound state lifetime
	this means that indivual lorentzians might be shifted (each by a different amount) in addition to the total line shape being asymmetric
Integration over both degrees of freedom will be an important discussion in the next chapter as we fit spectra and determine the halo binding energy

Outline from sources
-----------------------------------
# Cold collisions
	understand how to treat quantum two-body problem with external field coupling
	
	## Classical
		cross sections
			as a measure of the time between collisions
			
		potentials
			where they come from
		centrifugal barrier
			analog - slide 16 Julienne
			just rxp of particles
			
		center of mass coordinates
			only care  about relative (generally)
			simplifies calculations
	
	## Single channel scattering
quantum
	solve time0independent SE
	just need potential, basis set, and boundary conditions
		
structureless pasrticles scattering
	free space
		plane waves
		de Broglie wavelength
	
	delta function
		unitarity limit
		supports one bound state - the true halo state
		where the wavefunction comes from

	r-dependent potential
		show 1.1 from Hutson
		gneerally very complicated between atoms
			long-range part is typically has a power law drop off
			important that V->0 as R-> inf
		for ground state atoms dominant long-range part is R6
		
	scattering states (E>0)
		replusive barrier - particle scatter
		attrative well - particles accelerate
		
	bound states
		boundary conditions dictate
		might have quasibound states (shape resonances)
		
	wavefunctions
		General appraoch is incoming plane wave plus spherical wave
			
		common appraoch to expansion of wavefunction in partial wave expansion
			redefine SE in terms of partial waves
				Asymtotic solution from WKB
					V->0 so must go to plane wave
					See phase shift
					
		total cross section as sum over all partial waves

		### Low energy results
Simple form for scattering length
	gives limits on cross sections
	slide 24 (not sure I get the upper bound bit)

scattering length is a phase accumulation
	scattering length is very sensitive to details of potential
		can't really calculate ab initio
		
	a number that represent all the complex physics within the interaction region
	
	simple interpretation as peak shift at long range
		slide 12 julienne
	
Another way of seeing the origin of a is as the collisional E goes to zero
	wavefunction should go to a straight line
		plot from bertlett
	a is the intercept of that line on the internuclear axis
		this is one of the methods of actually determining a

the scattering length as a coupling parameter in length units
	The mean field energy (I think I had a reference on this)
	slide 26

Determmining a is not so easy because the interatomic potential is not known
	this was one of the pioneering use for photoassociation
	PA is sensitive to the collisional wavefunction and therefore can help to map out the spatial distribution of the ground state
Simple WKB estimation predicts zero-energy bound state as E->0
	every atom would have infinite scattering length at low energy
	obviously not the case, GF first to determine analytic corrections due to long-range vdW interaction
		comes about because of phase contribution from the long-range part
This is the regime we explored with our work in chapter 4
	probing a bound state just near the dissociation threshold makes us extremely sensitive to the entire phase of the well
			
		
	## Multichannel scattering
Everything we discussed was for unstructured particles
	this is the power of the scattering length
	
coupled equations are complicated
	point out references from Julienne, Mies, Bao, Hutson
	
multichannel use to describe atom-datom coupling
	mutli-channel model (normal MFR diagram)
	
define open and close channels	
	
these interaction can lead to phase resonances and inelastic loss in open channels
	MFR as example

S matrix - defines scattering phases and ampltiudes due to couplings between various open and closed channels
	S found from the asymptotic solutions

if single channel then S reprodcues above results
if inelastic then get complex scattering length (need better way to segue, Julienne 2014 slide 19 - unitarity argument maybe)
complex scat
	Real part is the elastic cross section
	Imag part if the inelastic

			
#Photoassocaition
Pretty much have everything needed from our previous section.
Relation of rate constant to cross sections is nice and simple
		Julienne 14 - slide 21
These fully coupled-channel models are not straightforward to evaluate.
	Can make assumption to simplify
			
	# One photon PAS
Can recreate the type of model for MFR in a field dressed approach
	plot showing photon + potential
	
ANalytic forms for modeling
	compare all the forms of K
		the crazy one from BJ 99
		the simple one with f(p)
		nicholson 42
	

show plot with all the terms defined

give loss rate (will need to have introduced before)
	define terms
		gamma_stim as overlap
		gamma as molecular lifetime
		delta as detuning
		A as coupling strength
	
introduce reflection approximation
	evaluation of overlap
	reference BJ 99
	
give relative momentum distribution
	this results in an asymmetric profile
	
Number equation vs. time

segue to narrow lines
	
		## PA on narrow lines

			quick note on the usage of the relative momentum distribution
			usually this is all we care about since the CoM part results in doppler shifts which would be neglible on the energy scales of broad dipole-allowed transtions
			using narrow intercombinations lines, the photon recoil energy is comparable to the bound state lifetime
				this means that indivual lorentzians might be shifted (each by a different amount) in addition to the total line shape being asymmetric
			Integration over both degrees of freedom will be an important discussion in the next chapter as we fit spectra and determine the halo binding energy
		
	## Two photon PAS
		Pretty much the same things
		
		Show new picture with all the couplings defined

So the biggest questions I feel ar still remaining are
	is S matrix the generalization os the phase shift formula to may channels
	what are some of the coupling mechanisms betwwn closed and open channels?
	what is the relation between universality and unitarity?
	what is the physical interpretation of a?
		also what are the relations of a, avdW, and aBar?
	
should try to be obnoxious about how the mutli-channel version has all the same analogs as the single channel theory
	point out the important bits
	
obviously, I need to go back and reread the questions but those are the ones that remain at the front of my mind currently. Ok, so next up. I have a couple things I want to do
	finish annotating the rest of the source material
		could be long and arduous for reviews. I don't want to lose momentum but I do want to read them. I may not do the entire outline thing but I should at least read them and highlight them
	could actually compile the list of questions I have before reading (probably better)
	keep trying to write a progression or an outline
		but I need to at least read GF and annotate
		if I am going to read GF then I might s well read eveything so that I can just get it over with.
		
so that is my plan. I'll compile the list, read through the last couple sources, then come back to the progression.

I need to decide on a narrative thread so that I can choose the plots which paint that picture. Tried building narrative by doing the summary sentences but that kinda got out of hand. Should force myself to outline and try to put summaries. 
	Key ideas that need to go together!!

All I need from Nicholson is that multi chan generalizes, the S matrix is the extension of the scatterig length, and then you can get the K formula pretty esily. Much asier way to present then to aruge the original method from the BJ paper
