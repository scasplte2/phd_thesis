I don't know what to say about this trap thing... or I don't know how to say it is really the problem. Why don't I know how to say it? I don't know what matters/ I don't rememeber how to calculate the data? How did I do that? Could I also go redo the other plot and fix the width?

I just want to read over my code for a second

I need to 

in chapter 3 I need to do everything that was done in the 08 paper

but I want the how to teach about the PA loss?

His aim was to predict the binding energies, understand the effects of bi-chromatic drive, and study the emergence of higher order loss processes.

	no notion but still gets some stuff
	kinda works
	fails at high I and large detuning
	
	We show that the three-level model captures key
experimentally observed features despite its simplicity.
Numerical simulations show that it accurately predicts
the appearance of additional spectral lines in the highintensity regime, and that these correspond to higher order non-linear processes. It accurately captures the location of the spectral peaks, including ac Stark shifts
from both lasers when intermediate state detuning, ∆1,
is comparable to E0
b
. Furthermore, when the intensity of
the lasers is not too small, the spectral lineshapes of individual lines are reasonably well-captured. This indicates
that effects missing from this theory – the motion of the
atoms [21], interaction shifts due to molecules and atoms
scattering off of other molecules and atoms [22], and the
varying density within the trap [18] – are less relevant in
the regime of interest here
