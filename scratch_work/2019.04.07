	Ch. 2 - trapping overview
	

Mi
	Look at figures
	App A - Imaging system

Pascal phd
	FIGS
		blue sat abs
		energy level splitting
		blue system
		blue image freq. scan
		87 hyperfine level structure
		lifetime study in magnetic trap
		repumping time
		number of atoms in different traps vs. time
		sequence timing diagrams
		689 sat abs
		2.15 - image of trapping potential
		
		
	2.1.1 - blue freq control
	2.1.2 - mixtures of 87 and 88
	2.2.1 - 87 Red MOT
		good discussion, will reference with Stellmer thesis
	2.3.2 - characterize ODT
	2.4.1 - imaging single isotope
		absorption coefficient
		87 imaging results in factor of two reduction counted
	2.4.2 - Imaging mixtures
		Main result is that contamination is a thing to worry about, so blow away
	
	
	

Natali phd
	consider figs
		timing diagram
		apparatus schemactic
		energy diagram
		sat abs diagram
		red mot timing sequence
		689 laser setup
		689 sat abs
		sample absorption image
		scan of 84 image freq
		PAS timing diagram
	
	2.2.1 - blue freq control
	app ? - notes on vacuum chamber
	app ? - high finesse cavity notes
	ch. 2 - good notes on laser cooling
	2.3 - red MOT trapping

Sarah phd
	FIG
		1.2 - values of the transitions
		2.4 - good blue schematic
		
	2.1 - Vacuum system (pretty useless)
	2.2.2 - 922 TA's

Francy masters
	Ch. 3 - Apparatus design and optimization

Pascal masters
	- doesn't seem super useful

Natali masters
	Ch. 1 - description of trapping
	Ch. 3 - electron shelving

Sarah masters
	- doesn't seem super useful

Ying Masters
	how to profile high power beams?
