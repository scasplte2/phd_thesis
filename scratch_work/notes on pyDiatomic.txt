what is vv GV and BV?


so what is the process for using this thig?
I somehow need to define the potential and the coupling but not quite sure what all is needed.
I want to get the wavefunctions for the harmonic well
Also unsure if this can do scattering states
	but that might be the easier job
	
so I can define multiple curves via the an array of dat files it seems

I'd love to do the classic examples of the GF potential, the box, and the delta function.
	I think the delta function might break but the box should definitely be doable.
	
First want to try and get a scattering wavefunction from an already defined potential
Then see if I can get the cross-section vs energy
