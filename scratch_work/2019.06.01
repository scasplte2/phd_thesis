# Probing the 86Sr halo state
	- What do we want to do in this paper?
		probe halo state
		vary delta_1 to extract the bound bound coupling
	- Why are we doing it?
		first test to see how the coupling work out
			asym -> asym, -1, and -2
			halo -> aysm, -1, and -2
		BJ model also makes assumptions about couplings, so want to test validity
	- What work has been done before and what are we adding?
		check calcium refs and refs from our paper
	- Reference to pulished work
	
	- FIG: potential (maybe with defs of directions)
	
	
# Experimental Setup
	- ind arm odt setup presented in ch. 2
		give typical densities, number, and temp
		
	- PA light
	- FIG: optical setup

# Theoretical description

## 3-level model
	- Describe theoretical model
	
	- FIG: spectra with fit
		Sample halo spectra fit using the two-photon method described in Ch. 3. 
	- FIG: model and predictions
		discuss deviation at higher intensity

## Extending to 4-levels
	- further detuning, can see clear deviation so simplest extension of theory is to add in a fourth level
	- motivated by the nearby -1 and asym

	- FIG: varyDetuning
	
	conclusion here about BJ coupling model?
		not too bad to think of as two separate processes
		acheived best prediction with a floquet model that predicts the binding energies
			develoed and dicussed in paper
			somewhere need to address that this model does not incorporate thermal effects so all of our analysis uses the more simple three level model originally developed by BJ.
			Can we incorporate thermal effecs into floquet model?
	
# Higher order peaks
	- observation of novel higher order peaks, also predicted by the simple theory
		simply multi-photon processes
		
	- FIG: higher order model

# Overview
	In our first experiments probing the 86 halo, prsented in the previous chapter, we probed the regime of strong coupling and observed large AC stark shifts and higher order Raman processes.
	These processes strongly perturbed the bare halo molecular state.
	Therefore, our next experiments choose to examine the weak coupling regime by applying low intensity excitations.
	This allows us to apply a simple isolated resonance model and precisely determine the effects of excitation lasers via intensity variation.
	Furthermore, we explored the 

# Experimental setup
	Fixed Detuning
	Varied 689 and IR

	Give brief description of sample and how it is achieved
	Discuss how photoassociation is performed

# Modeling the PA spectra
## Consideration of trap depth
	introduce the problem with the trap
	
	FIG: - Combined fig showing the change in distribution and the variation of the spectral fitting as the trap depth is varied
		other figs go into appendix
	
## Fitting the thermal lineshape
	

# Determining perturbations on the halo state
	account for local truncation of collision energy but not a local AC stark shift due to intensity (make sure of this)

## AC Stark shift due to excitation lasers

## Density dependent shift
	NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK HIS DENSITY SUSC. WITH NEW C6

## AC stark shift due to trapping lasers

# Unperturbed halo binding energy
## Chin method to extract

## Modification of the potential
ways to get scattering length from potential
	WKB method - integrate up from bottom of the potential to calculate the phase shift then apply GF form
	Wavefunction - Numerically solve and extrapolate the linear portion to zero crossing

All methods are generally self consisten in the end
