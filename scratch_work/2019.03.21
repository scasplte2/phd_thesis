Wanted to share this talk with everyone (very brief ~15 min)

Personally, this talk is one of the best summaries I've ever heard for why this space is important for the future of human interaction (and why I am so excited to be a part of it). The underlying premise is that blockchains should empower people to participate in mechanisms best suited for the scenario and in whatever context is appropriate to the parties involved. The goal of technology (blockchain or otherwise) should be to enable more efficient and effective communication, and the best way to do that is when our digital world can accurately reflect the types of social constructs and interactions we use in the physical world. 

What I find most exciting about this idea is that with an accurate digital representation we not only facilitate more effective interactions but we can also begin generating histories of these interactions and then can build new types of strucutres around this data that were't possible before. This is both exhilarating and terrifying in its vastness.

My new mantra is "build technology to let humans be better humans". I want to build systems and protocols that have fairness and accessibility baked into them from the very beginning. Imagine how the world could be different if children grew up with the expectation of equitability and opportunity, instead of the encumbrance of their (sometimes random) circumstance in life. 



 This means building systems which mix and match different aspects of trusted and trustless

Today, very few people get to experience the privilege of charting their own course through life. It is far too difficult

to 

Far too many resign themselves to a fate determined by random chance because they view some decisions as out of their control. 



My grand hope, as an individual and broadly for Topl, is to help build a future where your location of birth, the language you speak, or the beliefs you hold do not define your future. 



Obviously, that is a monumental task but 

This is a monumental task, but blockchains are

we level the playing field

when everyone can ask for proof

I want to say the world could be different if be expected fairness and equitability and don't .
