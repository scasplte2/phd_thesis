# Intro
	fig - halo fig

# Modeling the photoassocaition lineshape
	reminder of chapter 3
		put K in terms of p
		give S
	introduce A and Omega and describe
	discuss things needed for next steps
		density distribution
		energy truncation
		non-erogdicity

## Consideration of the trap depth
	fig - trap plot
	fig - f distritbuion
		recall in chap 3 we needed p1 and p2
		eqs
		
## Fitting the thermally averaged spectra
	eq - S with modifcations
	fig - truncated fit with varying eta
	fig - fit of 1064 spectra with bars
	
# Determining shifts

## 689 shift
	fig - 689 spectra
	fig - 689 susceptibility

## Density shift
	trap averaged density

## 1064 shift
	fig - 1064 susceptibility
	trap averaged intensity

# Discussion of the binding energy
	fig - 86 scattering length from GF
	fig - calculation of C6
	fig - 86 collisional wavefunction
		discussion like Ben's about getting the scattering length
	fig - 86 mass scaling
		eq - integral of the potential 
		basically how did I calculate the scattering lengrh
