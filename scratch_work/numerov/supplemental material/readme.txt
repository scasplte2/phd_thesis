Title: A renormalized potential following propagation algorithm for
                solving the coupled-channels equations

DEPOSIT INFORMATION

Description:
SCILAB and MATLAB routines for the developed potential following algorithms.
Test calculations with constant and linear potentials,
as well as the Secrest and Johnson test problem.[J. Chem. Phys., 45, 4556 (1966)]
This should contain two directories, called scilab and matlab, respectively.
The names of the directory indicate the program for which the scripts are intended.
The directory scilab should contain 15 files including ./scilab/readme.txt.
The directory matlab should contain 29 files including ./matlab/readme.txt.
Refer to these files for more information.
