* - The text section should outline the thought progression I want to pursue for that section. Think about the story you want to tell and how to present each figure and equation to make the point and then flow into the next section.

** - Should provide an overivew of the chapter at the end of each chapter introduction.

*** - Should default to following the outline of the source material itself and making notes in the section as I am reading. Highlight questions in yellow. If unstructured document or notes then make a heading denoting this.

Beginning work on a chapter/section should go through the following steps
1. Sketch possible outline or thought progression for the chapter
2. Setup outlines in thesis document and a new note document
3. Identify source material for each section
4. Read and annotate source material while noting any questions
5. Without consulting sources, sketch another outline or thought progression for the chapter/section
6. Compile questions from source material and try to answer them
7. Refine previous outlines with a focus on a summary of the section (what is the point of it?)
8. Identify all the figures and equations needed to make the point written in the summary
9. Wokr on finalizing the story and thought progression to logically flow through the figures and equations to make the point of the section.
