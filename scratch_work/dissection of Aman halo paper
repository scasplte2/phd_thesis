Two-photon spectroscopy is performed on ultracold 86Sr
atoms in a single-beam optical dipole trap (ODT) generated
from a 1064-nm laser propagating perpendicular to gravity
with beam waists of 260 and 26μm [17,22]. The tight waist
provides vertical confinement. The trap depth after an evaporative cooling stage determines the sample temperature, which
is set between 30 and 1000 nK. Typical atom numbers are
several hundred thousand and peak densities are as high as
2×1012 cm−3. The number of atoms and sample temperature
are measured using time-of-flight absorption imaging operating on the 1
S0-
1
P1 transition. Trap oscillation frequencies
are determined by measuring dipole and breathing collective
mode frequencies, which allow determination of trap volume
and sample density

For potentials that asymptote
to a van der Waals form, an additional parameter, the van
der Waals length lvdW, can be introduced for a more accurate description. Efimov trimers also exist in systems near a
scattering resonance, influencing dimer and atomic scattering
properties and introducing additional universal phenomena
[4,5]. 
** This provides a straightforward method for relating the halo state binding energy to properties of the nderlying atom

We
accurately determine the 86Sr2 binding energy, considering
possible collisional frequency shifts and ac Stark shifts due to
trapping and excitation lasers. Using the universal prediction
for the binding energy, including corrections derived for a
van der Waals potential [18–20], we derive a more accurate
value of the s-wave scattering length for 86Sr atomic collisions
[17,21].

## Trap bit
Equation (4) provides the correct thermal average when
the collision-energy distribution does not need to be truncated
(max → ∞). For our data, however, the ratio of sample
temperature to trap depth is kBT/Udepth ≈ 3 for samples with
temperature above 100 nK and drops to unity for 30 nK samples, so truncation effects are important. If the single-particle
kinetic-energy distribution function is a Boltzmann truncated
at Udepth − U(r), then the collision-energy distribution follows a Boltzmann distribution at low energies [ 	 Udepth −
U(r)] and falls off more quickly at larger energies, reaching
zero at 2[Udepth − U(r)]. We find that this treatment predicts
a narrower distribution on the red side of the spectral line than
we observe in our data, suggesting the presence of atoms in
nonergodic orbits with energies above the saddle point of the
trap. This is not surprising given the large collisional loss rate
associated with near-resonant scattering in this isotope. Fortunately, the molecular binding energy is strongly determined
by the sharp edge of the spectrum on the blue side of the line,
which is relatively insensitive to the description of the red tail.

## Spectral fit
EQ. 4
which is itself a thermal average of the scattering probability for loss (|S(,ω1,ω2,..., r)|
2) over the collision energy , with an energy cutoff max to be discussed momentarily. The trapping potential is given by U(r) = mgz +
hχ1064,gI1064(r) − U˜min, where mgz is the gravitational potential at height z, I1064(r) is the intensity of the trapping
light, and χ1064,g = 11 Hz/(W/cm2) [24] is proportional to
the polarizability of ground state atoms due to 1064 nm light.
U˜min is subtracted to set the potential at the trap minimum
to zero. The spatial integral is restricted to regions around
the trapping local minimum with U(r) less than the trap
depth [25]. Downhill regions on the other side of the saddle
point defining the trap depth are excluded.

Our data is fit well with a truncated Boltzmann distribution
of collision energies [Eq. (4)]. To estimate the systematic
uncertainty introduced by this treatment, we perform fits with
max equal to 2[Udepth − U(r)] and Udepth − U(r) and take the
mean of the two results as the best value for the binding
energy and half the difference as a systematic uncertainty
σmax ≈ 100 Hz. This procedure does not correctly represent
the overall normalization of K, but we are not concerned
with overall signal amplitude in this study. Atom temperatures
vary by no more than 20% during the interaction time, so
assuming a constant sample temperature is reasonable

Bohn and Julienne [26] provide an expression for
|S(,ω1,ω2,... )|
2 for a collision on the open channel of
two ground-state atoms (g) with total energy  leading to
loss-producing decay from the excited state b1 with rate γ1
(Fig. 1),
Eq. 5

For simplicity we have omitted the light shift of b1 due to
coupling to the scattering continuum [27]. This approach
was found to be sufficient for describing two-photon spectroscopy to a more deeply bound molecular level in 88Sr [17].
Equation (5) neglects all light shifts due to the trapping laser.
Light shifts due to the photoassociation lasers coupling to
states outside our model (Fig. 1) are also neglected. The
thermal energy is much greater than the zero-point energy
for trap motion, T 
 hνtrap/kB, so confinement effects are
negligible [28]. γ1 = 2γatomic, where γatomic = 4.7×104 s−1 is
the decay rate of the atomic 3
P1 level. γs() is the stimulated
width of b1 due to coupling to the initial scattering state by
laser 1, which for low energy can be expressed as [9,23,29]
EQ. 6

where the optical length (lopt ∝ I1) is related to the overlap
between the initial colliding state and b1, and k = (2μ)
1/2/h¯.
We take the intermediate state b1 as the ν = −2 state, for
which lopt/I = (1.5 ± 0.3)×104 a0/(W/cm2 ) [23], where
a0 = 5.29×10−11 m is the Bohr radius.

EQ. 7 - 9 (maybe I should move this stuff to ch. 3 though and pick up at Eq. 10)
For the experiments reported here, we maintain significant intermediate-state detuning 1 for which |1|
|2,12|.
Thus we are in a Raman configuration, and not in the
Autler-Townes regime [17]. In the Raman regime, Eq. (5)
shows a maximum near two-photon resonance at 2 + /h¯ =
2
2,12/41. Following a treatment discussed recently for a
similar experiment in calcium [9], if the detuning is restricted
to near two-photon resonance, then |S|
2 can be approximated
as a Lorentzian
In practice, the variation of collision energy is negligible
compared to the one-photon detuning 1.

There are several concerns regarding the rigorous application of the Bohn and Julienne theory [26] to our experiment.
The obvious one is that it assumes an isolated intermediate
state, which is not always a good approximation because of
the proximity of state b1 to the 1
S0 + 3
P1 asymptote and
to the ν = −1 state. Because of the small decay rate γ1 of
the intermediate molecular state associated with metastable
3
P1 atomic state, we also expect that loss from the ground
molecular state cannot be neglected.
The more subtle issue is that Eq. (7) is derived assuming
only a single laser beam is near resonant with each leg of
the two-photon transition, which is not a good approximation
for two-photon spectroscopy of a halo state and the resulting
small laser-frequency difference ω1 − ω2 ≈ −Eb2 	 |1|.
We can expect that coupling between pairs of states due to
both photoassociation lasers will contribute to the transition
strength and light shifts of the levels induced by the photoassociation lasers [26,27].

In the absence of a more complete theory treating these
effects, we analyze loss spectra using the effective expression
given by Eq. (10), where the observed molecular binding
energy (E
b2) includes any perturbations due to ac Stark or
collisional shifts:
Eq. 10

EQ. 11
Light shifts (ac Stark shifts) due to the trapping lasers
and collisions with ground-state atoms (density n) should
contribute to shifts of molecular resonance. Similar effects
were taken into account in a recent, high-precision study of
weakly bound molecular states of ultracold ytterbium atoms
[30]. In addition, we expect that both 689-nm excitation
lasers will shift the line, not just I2 ∝ 2
2,12. We model the
relationship between the measured resonance positions and
the unperturbed binding energy Eb2 as

The susceptibilities, in Hz per unit intensity or density, will be
determined from experimental data or theoretical considerations. The variation with position of the trapping laser intensity (I1064) and the density give rise to the spatial dependence
of |S|
2 and the need for a spatial average in Eq. (4). We take
I689 as twice the single-beam intensity I689 = 2I . The 689-nm
excitation beam is large enough compared to the atom sample
to neglect spatial variation. The functional form for the ac
Stark shift due to the excitation lasers is discussed in Sec. V.


At this point everything between the theory section and the determination of the couplig should go into this chapter. In addition need to have a section devoted to the discussion on the C6 calculation.
