Halo state molecules are molecules with a large
spatial extent, with most of the wavefunction residing in
the classically forbidden region [11]. Ultracold alkalineearth atoms are an exciting form of quantum matter [12],
offering extremely long-lived electronic clock states [13],
a large nuclear spin degeneracy in the fermionic isotopes
(up to N = 10 states for 87Sr), and an SU(N) symmetry
that can stabilize quantum fluctuations [14, 15].

The experimental system used here is 86Sr, which has a
weakly bound halo state in its ground electronic channel.
The unperturbed binding energy of this halo state was
accurately determined in a companion paper [10]. Otherwise, the only previous PA experiments with 86Sr have
been single-photon PA to excited electronic states [25–
27]. Photoassociation of Sr in general has been extensively studied because of interest in its scattering properties [18, 25, 28], optical Feshbach resonances [29–31],
excited state molecular potentials [26, 27, 32], quantum
chemistry [33–37], ultracold chemistry [30, 38], and the
formation of ground state molecules [39–41], which has
important applications, for example, in precision measurements [42]. We perform two-frequency photoassociation [6, 19, 43] of a ground state Sr molecule [10, 39–41],
similar to experiments in Yb [44] and Ca [45].

We investigate two-frequency photoassociation of a weakly bound molecular state, focusing on a
regime where the ac Stark shift is comparable to the binding energy. In this “high-intensity” regime,
we observe features absent in low-intensity two-frequency photoassociation. We experimentally
measure the spectra of 86Sr atoms coupled to the least bound state of the 86Sr2 ground electronic
channel through an intermediate electronically excited molecular state. We compare the spectra
to a simple three-level model that includes a two-frequency drive on each leg of the transition.
With numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation, we show that this model
accurately captures (1) the existence of experimentally observed satellite peaks that arise from
nonlinear processes, (2) the locations of the two-photon peak in the spectrum, including ac Stark
shifts, and (3) in some cases, spectral lineshapes. To better understand these numerical results, we
develop an approximate treatment of this model, based on Floquet and perturbation theory, that
gives simple formulas that accurately capture the binding energies. We expect these expressions to
be valuable tools to analyze and guide future two-frequency photoassociation experiments.

Accessing halo states in alkaline-earth atoms requires
different tools than in alkali atoms, as the former’s closed
electronic structure precludes the existence of magnetic
Feshbach resonances [5] and the formation of weakly
bound molecular states through magnetoassociation [16],
and it forbids one-photon processes from coupling a wellseparated pair of atoms to the halo dimer [17]. Consequently, Ref. [10] used two-photon photoassociation
(PA) through an intermediate molecular bound state
in an excited electronic channel, following techniques in
Refs. [6, 18, 19], as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). If the frequencies ωA and ωB of the two lasers are sufficiently different,
∗ wen.yu.kon@rice.edu

only one laser will be relevant for driving each leg of the
two-photon transition, corresponding to the commonly
used Λ-model [20, 21]. When the intermediate state detuning is much larger than the Rabi frequency of each
leg of the transition, the Λ-model predicts a single photoassociation peak at ωB − ωA = −Eb, where Eb < 0
is the binding energy (including light shift). (Here and
throughout, ~ = 1.)

In this paper, we measure spectra in the high-intensity
regime and develop a theory that accounts for the effects of the two-frequency drive when molecular binding energy is small and excitation laser intensity is high.
The model neglects motional degrees of freedom for the initial state of two free atoms and considers only three
levels: a dimer in the ground electronic state, the intermediate dimer state in the excited electronic potential,
and two well-separated atoms. We numerically solve this
model and analyze many of its features with analytic approximations. We also briefly consider extensions of this
three-level model that add extra levels to capture some
fine details of the ac Stark shift at large detuning.

The Sr system has been extensively studied with ab
initio methods that predict photoassociation rates from
first principles [46]. We emphasize that here we focus on
an isolated few-level system and the new photassociation
phenomena that arise at high laser intensity where the
Rabi frequency is not small compared to Sr2 halo state
binding energy. We note that this is still a very low laser
intensity, where the Rabi frequency remains small compared to the detuning from other molecular, rotational
and vibrational states not part of the isolated few-level
system considered here. Rather than calculate FrankCondon factors and dipole transition matrix elements
from an ab initio approach [46, 47], we take these as phenomenological fit parameters in our theoretical descriptions. This is in the same spirit as the standard BohnJulienne description of photoassociation spectra [6, 43].
Once these parameters are fixed, this theory is expected
to be accurate when collisional energies and Rabi frequencies are low compared to the detuning to other energy states (ie where the system can still be considered
an isolated few-level system). This formalism has been
applied successfully in many settings [48, 49], including
systems with complicated electronic structures such as
Ca [45], Sr [10, 18, 32], and Yb [50].

############ EXPERIMENTAL SETUP ##################################################################
We perform two-frequency PA spectroscopy of 86Sr
atoms, where the atoms are coupled to a halo state on
the molecular potential of the 86Sr2 ground electronic
state through an intermediate molecular bound state.
Two PA lasers with frequencies ωA and ωB, intensities
IA and IB, and the same linear polarization are applied
to ultracold 86Sr in an optical dipole trap, as illustrated
in Fig. 1(a). The temperature in the trap is typically
300 nK. We use equal PA laser intensities in the experiment, IA = IB = I. By scanning the frequency of laser
B, we obtain a spectrum of atom loss as a function of the
frequency difference of PA lasers, i.e. ∆ω = ωB − ωA,
in the regime ∆ω < 0. When the two-photon process
is resonant with the binding energy, ∆ω = Eb, there is
significant atom loss through inelastic processes acting
on the bound halo state and intermediate excited molecular state, and we expect a peak to be present in the
atom loss spectrum. From the spectral peaks, we extract the binding energy by fitting the lineshape to a
convolution of the asymmetric loss function described in
Ref. [10] with a Lorentzian, which provides good fit to
the lineshape for all intensities. We measure spectra for
different intermediate-state detunings, ∆1 = ωA − E1,
and PA laser intensities to determine the dependence of
light shifts on these parameters. More details of the experimental setup can be found in Ref. [10], where lowintensity spectra are reported and the unperturbed binding energy, E0
b
, was determined to be -83.0 ± 0.3 kHz.

############ THEORY ##############################################################################
In high-intensity measurements reported in the present
paper, we observe features absent in the Λ-model where
only a single laser drives each leg of the PA process. Most
notable are additional peaks near ∆ω = ±Eb/n for integer n, as shown in the spectra in Fig. 1(c-e). In Sec. VI,
we will explain these peaks in terms of non-linear processes illustrated in Fig. 1(b) that become possible with
the two-frequency drive. These additional peaks are more
apparent at higher PA laser intensity and lower detuning.

The peaks we observe in the experiment also experience strong light shifts, and understanding these is complicated by both lasers driving each leg of the transition. We gain insight into the challenges that the twofrequency drive presents for predicting the ac Stark shift
by considering two regimes. The first limit is when ωA
and ωB are far apart, corresponding to large binding energy. The two lasers oscillate at very different frequencies
and thus we do not expect the interference term to contribute. In this case, the ac Stark effects from each laser
add independently, giving a contribution proportional to
IA
4(∆1−∆ω) +
IB
4∆1
for ∆ω > 0, a formula that has been
suggested and used in Refs. [22, 44]. The second limit is
when ωA and ωB are nearly equal and the electric fields
E~A and E~
b add constructively, where the total electric
field amplitude is E~ = E~A + E~B. In this case, one obtains a Stark shift proportional to IA+IB+2√
IAIB
4∆1
. The
experiments reported in this paper were performed at an
intermediate regime to these limits. Section IV A will
present results from numerical simulations that describe
the shifts in this intermediate regime, and Section IV B
derives analytic expressions capable of capturing the behavior in relevant limits.
