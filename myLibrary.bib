abstract = {This best-selling classic provides a graduate-level, non-historical, modern introduction of quantum mechanical concepts. The author, J. J. Sakurai, was a renowned theorist in particle theory. This revision by Jim Napolitano retains the original material and adds topics that extend the text's usefulness into the 21st century. The introduction of new material, and modification of existing material, appears in a way that better prepares the student for the next course in quantum field theory. You will still find such classic developments as neutron interferometer experiments, Feynman path integrals, correlation measurements, and Bell's inequality. The style and treatment of topics is now more consistent across chapters.     The Second Edition has been updated for currency and consistency across all topics and has been checked for the right amount of mathematical rigor.},

abstract = {A review is presented of some of the principal techniques of laser cooling and trapping that have been devel- oped during the past 20 years. Its approach is primarily experimental, but its quantitative descriptions are consistent in notation with most of the theoretical literature. It begins with a simplified introduction to op- tical forces on atoms, including both cooling and trapping. Then its three main sections discuss its three se- lected features, (1) quantization of atomic motion, (2) effects of the multilevel structure of atoms, and (3) the effects of polychromatic light. Each of these features is an expansion in a different direction from the simplest model of a classical, two-level atom moving in a monochromatic laser field.},

@article{Lesanovsky2014,
abstract = {The non-equilibrium dynamics of a gas of cold atoms in which Rydberg states are off-resonantly excited is studied in the presence of noise. The interplay between interaction and off-resonant excitation leads to an initial dynamics where aggregates of excited Rydberg atoms slowly nucleate and grow, eventually reaching long-lived meta-stable arrangements which then relax further on much longer timescales. This growth dynamics is governed by an effective Master equation which permits a transparent and largely analytical understanding of the underlying physics. By means of extensive numerical simulations we study the many-body dynamics and the correlations of the resulting non-equilibrium states in various dimensions. Our results provide insight into the dynamical richness of strongly interacting Rydberg gases in noisy environments, and highlight the usefulness of these kind of systems for the exploration of soft-matter-type collective behaviour.},

The microscopic origin of these states is fundamentally different from Efimov physics. Two stable trimer configurations exist where the atoms form the vertices of an equilateral triangle in a plane perpendicular to a static electric field. The triangle edge length typically exceeds R?2 ?m, and each configuration is twofold degenerate due to Kramers degeneracy. The depth of the potential wells and the triangle edge length can be controlled by external parameters.We establish the Borromean nature of the trimer states, analyze the quantum dynamics in the potential wells, and describe methods for their production and detection.},

Frequency and power of the laser field coupling 6S1/2 and 6P3/2 levels are tuned to influence the population redistribution of 6P3/2 and nS levels excited by another light. The profile of AT spectroscopy is measured experimentally and compared with the theoretical simulation considering the estimated large dephasing rates caused by interaction between Rydberg atoms, which demonstrates that splitting and profile of AT spectra are strongly dependent on the interaction between Rydberg atoms. Rabi frequency of the coupling laser and transition dipole moment of 6S1/2→ 6P3/2 are deduced via fitting the measured space variation of two splitting peaks, which is consistent with theoretical calculations.},

@article{Bakr2009,
abstract = {Recent years have seen tremendous progress in creating complex atomic many-body quantum systems. One approach is to use macroscopic, effectively thermodynamic ensembles of ultracold atoms to create quantum gases and strongly correlated states of matter, and to analyse the bulk properties of the ensemble. For example, bosonic and fermionic atoms in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice can be used for quantum simulations of solid-state models. The opposite approach is to build up microscopic quantum systems atom-by-atom, with complete control over all degrees of freedom. The atoms or ions act as qubits and allow the realization of quantum gates, with the goal of creating highly controllable quantum information systems. Until now, the macroscopic and microscopic strategies have been fairly disconnected. Here we present a quantum gas 'microscope' that bridges the two approaches, realizing a system in which atoms of a macroscopic ensemble are detected individually and a complete set of degrees of freedom for each of them is determined through preparation and measurement. By implementing a high-resolution optical imaging system, single atoms are detected with near-unity fidelity on individual sites of a Hubbard-regime optical lattice. The lattice itself is generated by projecting a holographic mask through the imaging system. It has an arbitrary geometry, chosen to support both strong tunnel coupling between lattice sites and strong on-site confinement. Our approach can be used to directly detect strongly correlated states of matter; in the context of condensed matter simulation, this corresponds to the detection of individual electrons in the simulated crystal. Also, the quantum gas microscope may enable addressing and read-out of large-scale quantum information systems based on ultracold atoms.},

abstract = {We present an optical setup with focus-tunable lenses to dynamically control the waist and focus position of a laser beam, in which we transport a trapped ultracold cloud of 87-Rb over a distance of 28 cm. The scheme allows us to shift the focus position at constant waist, providing uniform trapping conditions over the full transport length. The fraction of atoms that are transported over the entire distance comes near to unity, while the heating of the cloud is in the range of a few microkelvin. We characterize the position stability of the focus and show that residual drift rates in focus position can be compensated for by counteracting with the tunable lenses. Beyond being a compact and robust scheme to transport ultracold atoms, the reported control of laser beams makes dynamic tailoring of trapping potentials possible. As an example, we steer the size of the atomic cloud by changing the waist size of the dipole beam.},

Because of the large dipolar coupling between two Rydberg atoms, a small admixture of Rydberg character into a ground state can produce an atom with a dipole moment of a few Debye, the appropriate size to observe interesting dipolar physics effects in cold atom systems. We have calculated the interaction energies for atoms that interact via the dipole-dipole interaction and find that due to blockade effects, the R-dependent two-atom interaction terms are limited in size, and can be R-independent up until the dipolar energy is equal to the detuning. This produces R-dependent interactions different from the expected 1/R{\^{}}3 dipolar form, which have no direct analogy in condensed matter physics, and could lead to new quantum phases in trapped Rydberg systems.},

abstract = {In Sri Lanka, over one in three women experience intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization in their lifetime, making it a serious public health concern. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as child abuse and neglect, witnessing domestic violence, parental separation, and bullying are also widespread. Studies in Western settings have shown positive associations between ACEs and IPV perpetration in adulthood, but few have examined this relationship in a non-Western context. In the present study, we examined the association of ACEs with IPV perpetration among Sri Lankan men surveyed for the UN Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific. We found statistically significant positive associations between the number of ACE categories (ACE score) and emotional, financial, physical, and sexual IPV perpetration among Sri Lankan men. We analyzed the contributions of each ACE category and found that childhood abuse was strongly associated with perpetration of IPV in adulthood, with sexual abuse associated with the greatest increase in odds of perpetration (Adjusted odds ratio 2.36; 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.69, 3.30). Witnessing abuse of one's mother was associated with the greatest increase in the odds of perpetrating physical IPV (AOR 1.82; 95{\%} CI: 1.29, 2.58), while lack of a male parental figure was not associated with physical IPV perpetration (AOR 0.76; 95{\%} CI: 0.53, 1.09). These findings support a social learning theory of IPV perpetration, in which children who are exposed to violence learn to perpetrate IPV in adulthood. They also suggest that in Sri Lanka, being raised in a female-headed household does not increase the risk of IPV perpetration in adulthood compared to being raised in a household with a male parental figure. The relationship between being raised in a female-headed household (the number of which increased dramatically during Sri Lanka's recent civil war) and perpetration of IPV warrants further study. Interventions that aim to decrease childhood abuse in Sri Lanka could both protect children now and reduce IPV in the future, decreasing violence on multiple fronts.},

abstract = {Atomic polarization phenomena impinge upon a number of areas and processes in physics. The dielectric constant and refractive index of any gas are examples of macroscopic properties that are largely determined by the dipole polarizability. When it comes to microscopic phenomena, the existence of alkaline-earth anions and the recently discovered ability of positrons to bind to many atoms are predominantly due to the polarization interaction. An imperfect knowledge of atomic polarizabilities is presently looming as the largest source of uncertainty in the new generation of optical frequency standards. Accurate polarizabilities for the group I and II atoms and ions of the periodic table have recently become available by a variety of techniques. These include refined many-body perturbation theory and coupled-cluster calculations sometimes combined with precise experimental data for selected transitions, microwave spectroscopy of Rydberg atoms and ions, refractive index measurements in microwave cavities, ab initio calculations of atomic structures using explicitly correlated wave functions, interferometry with atom beams, and velocity changes of laser cooled atoms induced by an electric field. This review examines existing theoretical methods of determining atomic and ionic polarizabilities, and discusses their relevance to various applications with particular emphasis on cold-atom physics and the metrology of atomic frequency standards.},

A new design is presented here, using a single integrated circuit originally intended for controlling dc motors. A digital input signal switches a unipolar power supply bidirectionally through the voice coil. Short high-current pulses are generated on the transitions to ensure rapid shutter action, while a low holding current reduces the power requirement and heating of the actuator. The circuit can reverse the current to brake the shutter and reduce the impact at the end of its travel. With a focused laser beam, the shutter achieves rise times below 500 ns. A method for producing variable length pulses is also described, demonstrating durations as short as 700 ns.},

Analyzing the driven dissipative dynamics of the atomic gas, we show that the interplay between coherent light coupling, radiative decay and strong Rydberg-Rydberg atom interactions leads to the emergence of sizeable effective interactions while providing remarkably long coherence times. The latter are studied experimentally in a cold gas of strontium atoms for which the proposed scheme is most efficient.

abstract = {The physics of quantum degenerate Fermi gases in uniform as well as in harmonically trapped configurations is reviewed from a theoretical perspective. Emphasis is given to the effect of interactions which play a crucial role, bringing the gas into a superfluid phase at low temperature. In these dilute systems interactions are characterized by a single parameter, the s-wave scattering length, whose value can be tuned using an external magnetic field near a Feshbach resonance. The BCS limit of ordinary Fermi superfluidity, the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of dimers and the unitary limit of large scattering length are important regimes exhibited by interacting Fermi gases. In particular the BEC and the unitary regimes are characterized by a high value of the superfluid critical temperature, of the order of the Fermi temperature. Different physical properties are discussed, including the density profiles and the energy of the ground-state configurations, the momentum distribution, the fraction of condensed pairs, collective oscillations and pair breaking effects, the expansion of the gas, the main thermodynamic properties, the behavior in the presence of optical lattices and the signatures of superfluidity, such as the existence of quantized vortices, the quenching of the moment of inertia and the consequences of spin polarization. Various theoretical approaches are considered, ranging from the mean-field description of the BCS-BEC crossover to non-perturbative methods based on quantum Monte Carlo techniques. A major goal of the review is to compare the theoretical predictions with the available experimental results.},

abstract = {Understanding the rich behavior that emerges from systems of interacting quantum particles, such as electrons in materials, nucleons in nuclei or neutron stars, the quark-gluon plasma, and superfluid liquid helium, requires investigation of systems that are clean, accessible, and have tunable parameters. Ultracold quantum gases offer tremendous promise for this application largely due to an unprecedented control over interactions. Specifically, {\$}a{\$}, the two-body scattering length that characterizes the interaction strength, can be tuned to any value. This offers prospects for experimental access to regimes where the behavior is not well understood because interactions are strong, atom-atom correlations are important, mean-field theory is inadequate, and equilibrium may not be reached or perhaps does not even exist. Of particular interest is the unitary gas, where {\$}a{\$} is infinite, and where many aspects of the system are universal in that they depend only on the particle density and quantum statistics. While the unitary Fermi gas has been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical investigation, the degenerate unitary Bose gas has generally been deemed experimentally inaccessible because of three-body loss rates that increase dramatically with increasing {\$}a{\$}. Here, we investigate dynamics of a unitary Bose gas for timescales that are short compared to the loss. We find that the momentum distribution of the unitary Bose gas evolves on timescales fast compared to losses, and that both the timescale for this evolution and the limiting shape of the momentum distribution are consistent with universal scaling with density. This work demonstrates that a unitary Bose gas can be created and probed dynamically, and thus opens the door for further exploration of this novel strongly interacting quantum liquid.},

The model equation that GPELab solves is the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The aim of this first part is to present the physical problems and the robust and accurate numerical schemes that are implemented for computing stationary solutions, to show a few computational examples and to explain how the basic GPELab functions work. Problems that can be solved include: 1d, 2d and 3d situations, general potentials, large classes of local and nonlocal nonlinearities, multi-components problems, and fast rotating gases. The toolbox is developed in such a way that other physics applications that require the numerical solution of general Schr{\"{o}}dinger-type equations can be considered. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {ATUS-PRO is a solver-package written in C++ designed for the calculation of numerical solutions of the stationary- and the time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation for local two-particle contact interaction utilising finite element methods. These are implemented by means of the deal.II library (Bangerth et al., 0000) [1], (Bangerth et al., 2007) [2]. The code can be used in order to perform simulations of Bose-Einstein condensates in gravito-optical surface traps, isotropic and full anisotropic harmonic traps, as well as for arbitrary trap geometries. A special feature of this package is the possibility to calculate non-ground state solutions (topological modes, excited states) (Marojevi{\'{c}} et al., 2013), (Yukalov et al., 1997, 2004) [3,4] for an arbitrarily high non-linearity term. The solver-package is designed to run on parallel distributed machines and can be applied to problems in one, two, or three spatial dimensions with axial symmetry or in Cartesian coordinates. The time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved by means of the fully implicit Crank-Nicolson method, whereas stationary states are obtained with a modified version based on our own constrained Newton method (Marojevi{\'{c}} et al., 2013). The latter method enables to find the excited state solutions.},

Ultracold 85Rb atoms sitting in a dc magnetic field near the 155 G Feshbach resonance are associated by applying a small sinusoidal oscillation to the magnetic field. There is resonant atom to molecule conversion when the modulation frequency closely matches the molecular binding energy. We observe that the atom to molecule conversion efficiency depends strongly on the frequency, amplitude, and duration of the applied modulation and on the phase space density of the sample. This technique offers high conversion efficiencies without the necessity of crossing or closely approaching the Feshbach resonance and allows precise spectroscopic measurements.

The two orbital states are represented by two different (meta-)stable electronic configurations of fermionic Yb-173. A strong spin-exchange between particles in the two separate orbitals is mediated by the contact interaction between atoms, which we characterize by clock shift spectroscopy in a 3D optical lattice. We find the system to be SU(N)-symmetric within our measurement precision and characterize all relevant scattering channels for atom pairs in combinations of the ground and the excited state. Elastic scattering between the orbitals is dominated by the antisymmetric channel, which leads to the strong spin-exchange coupling. The exchange process is directly observed, by characterizing the dynamic equilibration of spin imbalances between two large ensembles in the two orbital states, as well as indirectly in atom pairs via interaction shift spectroscopy in a 3D lattice. The realization of a stable SU(N)-symmetric two-orbital Hubbard Hamiltonian opens the route towards experimental quantum simulation of condensed-matter models based on orbital interactions, such as the Kondo lattice model.},

abstract = {When an excited atomic electron interacts with a neutral perturbing atom or molecule that possesses a shape resonance, it generates a characteristic class of Born–Oppenheimer potential curves that rise with internuclear distance. We document this effect, and predict the existence of a diverse class of stable, strongly bound atom–atom and atom–molecule states that result from this phenomenon. For the specific case in which Rb is the perturbing atom, we show that such states should be observable in the spectroscopy of an ultracold gas or condensate. M This article features online multimedia enhancements When an atom in a low-lying excited state or a Rydberg state is brought near a ground state atom or molecule, much of the interaction derives from simple electron scattering off the ground state species. This picture was developed in a classic paper by Fermi [1] to describe pressure shifts of atomic Rydberg spectral lines. In a high Rydberg state, the electron kinetic energy is so low that the electron–perturber scattering is primarily s-wave, and in that case the main physics is carried by the s-wave scattering length. A recent study [2] showed that, in an ultracold gas, the negative 3 S-wave scattering length can produce a new type of ultralong-range molecule with unusual properties. The purpose of this letter is to predict the existence of a new and very different class of long-range molecular states that arise when the electron–perturber scattering exhibits a shape resonance. Electron–atom or electron–molecule shape resonances have been studied extensively in their own right, but their manifestation as features in a Born– Oppenheimer molecular potential curve or surface has apparently not been elucidated. Among the properties that we predict are: (i) much stronger binding energies than were predicted for other predicted classes of long-range Rydberg states; (ii) in some cases, the existence of large permanent electric dipole moments.

In addition to exploring the Mott insulator-metal crossover, we calculate final temperatures achieved by the standard experimental protocol of adiabatically ramping from a noninteracting gas, as a function of initial gas temperature. Of particular experimental interest, we find that increasing N for fixed particle numbers and initial temperatures gives substantially colder Mott insulators after the adiabatic ramping, up to more than a factor of 5 for relevant parameters. This cooling happens for all N, fixing the initial entropy, or for all N≲20 (the exact value depends on dimensionality), at fixed, experimentally relevant initial temperatures.},

Novel semiclassical cooling process, some of which are intimately linked to gravity, are also explored. Moreover, for laser frequencies tuned above the atomic resonance, we demonstrate momentum-space crystals containing up to 26 well defined lattice points. Gravitationally assisted cooling is also achieved with blue-detuned light. Theoretically, we find the blue detuned dynamics are universal to Doppler limited systems.

Using quantum gases in optical lattices, superfluids can be realized over a wide range of tunable parameters, with a continuous connection to the regime of strong correlation. However, for full experimental access and a comprehensive comparison with condensed-matter systems, there is a need for new detection techniques to probe their essential physics. Here we report on a comprehensive study of superfluids in optical lattices by Bragg spectroscopy. We present fully momentum-resolved measurements of the band structure and associated interaction effects at several lattice depths. In addition, we directly study the composition of excitations and observe strong indications for Bogoliubov backscattering. Our measurements demonstrate the applicability and limits of the Bogoliubov theory to describe excitation properties of superfluids in periodic potentials and should pave the way for detailed studies of strongly correlated phases.},

It is argued that probabilities like this which pertain to continuous monitoring possess operational meaning. A simple natural approach to this problem leads to the conclusion that an unstable particle which is continuously observed to see whether it decays will never be found to decay!. Since recording the track of an unstable particle (which can be distinguished from its decay products) approximately realizes such continuous observations, the above conclusion seems to pose a paradox which we call Zeno's paradox in quantum theory. The relation of this result to that of some previous works and its implications and possible resolutions are briefly discussed. The mathematical transcription of the above‐mentioned conclusion is a structure theorem concerning semigroups. Although special cases of this theorem are known, the general formulation and the proof given here are believed to be new. We also note that the known ''no‐go'' theorem concerning the semigroup law for the reduced evolution of any physical system (including decaying systems) is subsumed under our theorem as a direct corollary.},

abstract = {With the production of polar molecules in the quantum regime, long-range dipolar interactions are expected to facilitate understanding of strongly interacting many-body quantum systems and to realize lattice spin models for exploring quantum magnetism. In ordinary atomic systems, where contact interactions require wavefunction overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be mediated by tunnelling, through a process referred to as superexchange; however, the coupling is relatively weak and is limited to nearest-neighbour interactions. In contrast, dipolar interactions exist even in the absence of tunnelling and extend beyond nearest neighbours. This allows coherent spin dynamics to persist even for gases with relatively high entropy and low lattice filling. Measured effects of dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have been limited to the modification of inelastic collisions and chemical reactions. Here we use dipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a three-dimensional optical lattice to realize a lattice spin model. Spin is encoded in rotational states of molecules that are prepared and probed by microwaves. Resonant exchange of rotational angular momentum between two molecules realizes a spin-exchange interaction. The dipolar interactions are apparent in the evolution of the spin coherence, which shows oscillations in addition to an overall decay of the coherence. The frequency of these oscillations, the strong dependence of the spin coherence time on the lattice filling factor and the effect of a multipulse sequence designed to reverse dynamics due to two-body exchange interactions all provide evidence of dipolar interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the suppression of loss in weak lattices due to a continuous quantum Zeno mechanism. Measurements of these tunnelling-induced losses allow us to determine the lattice filling factor independently. Our work constitutes an initial exploration of the behaviour of many-body spin models with direct, long-range spin interactions and lays the groundwork for future studies of many-body dynamics in spin lattices.},

We recall how to calculate the field radiated by a superradiant system in a single experiment and how to determine, for a series of identically prepared superradiant samples, the large shot to shot fluctuations of the emitted light properties.

Focusing on the SU( n {\textgreater}2) generalizations of ferromagnetism, it is shown within mean-field theory that the transition from the paramagnet to the itinerant ferromagnet is generically first order. On symmetry grounds, general SU( n ) itinerant ferromagnetic ground states and their topological excitations are also discussed. These SU( n {\textgreater}2) ferromagnets can become stable by increasing the scattering length using optical methods or in an optical lattice. However, in an optical lattice at current experimental temperatures, Mott states with different filling are expected to coexist in the same trap, as obtained from a calculation based on the SU(6) Hubbard model.},

We attribute the increased linewidth to resonant dipole-dipole interactions of 18s atoms with spontaneously created populations of nearby np states. Over a range of initial atomic densities and excitation strengths, the transition width is described by a single function of the steady-state density of Rydberg atoms, and the observed resonant excitation rate corresponds to that of a two-level system with the measured, rather than natural, linewidth.

Despite the strong interactions the evolution can still be reversed by a simple phase shift in the excitation laser field. We experimentally prove the coherence of the excitation in the strong blockade regime by applying an `optical rotary echo' technique to a sample of magnetically trapped ultracold atoms, analogous to a method known from nuclear magnetic resonance. We additionally measured the dephasing time due to the interaction between the Rydberg atoms.},

abstract = {We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the effects of Rydberg interactions on Autler-Townes spectra of ultracold gases of atomic strontium. Realizing two-photon Rydberg excitation via a long-lived triplet state allows us to probe the thus far unexplored regime where Rydberg state decay presents the dominant decoherence mechanism. The effects of Rydberg interactions are observed in shifts, asymmetries, and broadening of the measured atom-loss spectra. The experiment is analyzed within a one-body density matrix approach, accounting for interaction-induced level shifts and dephasing through nonlinear terms that approximately incorporate correlations due to the Rydberg blockade. This description yields good agreement with our experimental observations for short excitation times. For longer excitation times, the loss spectrum is altered qualitatively, suggesting additional dephasing mechanisms beyond the standard blockade mechanism based on pure van der Waals interactions.},

abstract = {We demonstrate control of the collapse and expansion of an 88Sr Bose-Einstein condensate using an optical Feshbach resonance (OFR) near the 1S0-3P1 intercombination transition at 689 nm. Significant changes in dynamics are caused by modifications of scattering length by up to +- ?10a{\_}bg, where the background scattering length of 88Sr is a{\_}bg = -2a0 (1a0 = 0.053 nm). Changes in scattering length are monitored through changes in the size of the condensate after a time-of-flight measurement. Because the background scattering length is close to zero, blue detuning of the OFR laser with respect to a photoassociative resonance leads to increased interaction energy and a faster condensate expansion, whereas red detuning triggers a collapse of the condensate. The results are modeled with the time-dependent nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation.},

The measurements demonstrate that a rapid decrease in the ground-state atom population in the ODT occurs even for weak dressing and when well detuned from resonance. This decrease is attributed to Rydberg atom excitation, which can lead to direct escape from the trap and to population of very long-lived 5s5p 3 P 0,2 metastable states. The effects of interactions between Rydberg atoms, including those populated by blackbody radiation, are analyzed. The work has important implications when considering the use of Rydberg dressing to control the interactions between dressed ground-state atoms.},

abstract = {Introduction: Studies conducted amongst the inhabitants of high altitude suggested that systolic and diastolic blood pressures are lower in the high than in low altitude population. So a study was designed to look at the blood pressure values among permanent residents of high altitudes of rural Western Nepal. Methods: This is a descriptive cross sectional study conducted at two different altitudes (2670 and 2950 meters) of Humla District, Nepal, looking at the blood pressure values among the permanent inhabitants at these altitudes. Results: Total number of 137 subjects with 73 (53.3{\%}) from 2950 meters and 64 (46.7{\%}) from 2670 meters altitude were enrolled. Mean age of the study population was 35.29 years. Male were 57 (41.6{\%}) and female 80 (58.4{\%}). The difference in systolic blood pressures (118.59 and 114.66 mmHg, P=0.01) and mean arterial pressures (92.0 and 89.5 mmHg, P=0.02) at the altitudes of 2670 and 2950 meters were statistically significant whereas the difference in diastolic BP at these altitudes were not statistically significant. There was no significant correlation of BMI with blood pressure values and no difference was noted in the blood pressure values among the two different ethnic groups at the given altitudes. Conclusions: Lower rate of hypertension was observed among the inhabitants of high altitude of rural western Nepal. Blood pressure was found to decreases with increase in altitude among permanent inhabitants of high altitude.

The spin degrees of freedom of ultracold neutral atoms in their ground electronic state provide a natural platform for such applications thanks to their long coherence times and the ability to control them with magneto-optical fields. However, the creation of strong coherent coupling between spins has been challenging. Here we demonstrate a strong and tunable Rydberg-dressed interaction between spins of individually trapped caesium atoms with energy shifts of order 1 MHz in units of Planck[rsquor]s constant. This interaction leads to a ground-state spin-flip blockade, whereby simultaneous hyperfine spin flips of two atoms are inhibited owing to their mutual interaction. We employ this spin-flip blockade to rapidly produce single-step Bell-state entanglement between two atoms with a fidelity [ge]81(2){\%}.},

abstract = {The behavior of the momentum transferred to a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate by a two-photon Bragg pulse reflects the structure of the underlying Bogoliubov spectrum. In elongated condensates, axial phonons with different number of radial nodes give rise to a multibranch spectrum which can be resolved in Bragg spectroscopy, as shown by Steinhauer {\{}$\backslash$it et al.{\}} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\{}$\backslash$bf 90{\}}, 060404 (2003)]. Here we present a detailed theoretical analysis of this process. We calculate the momentum transferred by numerically solving the time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In the case of a cylindrical condensate, we compare the results with those obtained by linearizing the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and using a quasiparticle projection method. This analysis shows how the axial-phonon branches affect the momentum transfer, in agreement with our previous interpretation of the observed data. We also discuss the applicability of this type of spectroscopy to typical available condensates, as well as the role of nonlinear effects.},

@article{Kofman2000,
abstract = {In theory, the decay of any unstable quantum state can be inhibited by sufficiently frequent measurements--the quantum Zeno effect. Although this prediction has been tested only for transitions between two coupled, essentially stable states, the quantum Zeno effect is thought to be a general feature of quantum mechanics, applicable to radioactive or radiative decay processes. This generality arises from the assumption that, in principle, successive observations can be made at time intervals too short for the system to change appreciably. Here we show not only that the quantum Zeno effect is fundamentally unattainable in radiative or radioactive decay (because the required measurement rates would cause the system to disintegrate), but also that these processes may be accelerated by frequent measurements. We find that the modification of the decay process is determined by the energy spread incurred by the measurements (as a result of the time-energy uncertainty relation), and the distribution of states to which the decaying state is coupled. Whereas the inhibitory quantum Zeno effect may be feasible in a limited class of systems, the opposite effect--accelerated decay--appears to be much more ubiquitous.},

@article{Kondov2013,
abstract = {Open questions abound regarding how the interplay between disorder and inter-particle interactions affects essential properties of electronic solids. For example, a complete understanding of how competing phases and disorder conspire to create inhomogeneity in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates and the role of disorder in materials that exhibit colossal magnetoresistance, such as the manganites, has been elusive despite decades of active research. Fundamental transport issues, such as whether interactions enhance or inhibit localization of metallic phases, also remain unresolved. Here we use ultracold atoms trapped in a disordered optical lattice to realize a minimal model for strongly correlated, disordered electronic solids---the disordered Fermi Hubbard model (DFHM)---and to probe the impact of disorder on the metallic and Mott insulator (MI) phases. We measure a disorder-driven metal--insulator transition, and we observe that interactions raise the critical disorder energy, thereby stabilizing the metallic phase. Introducing disorder in the MI regime creates density fluctuations that are consistent with disruption of the Hubbard gap. Because we utilize fully known and controllable disorder, our work supports new and more stringent tests of theoretical and numerical approaches to understanding the influence of disorder on strongly correlated systems. If lower temperatures can be reached in optical lattices, our methods may enable measurements of the effect of disorder on the analogue of high-temperature superconductivity.},

abstract = {We predict feasibility of the photoassociative formation of Sr{\_}2 molecules in arbitrary vibrational levels of the electronic ground state based on state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. Key is the strong spin-orbit interaction between the c{\^{}}3$\backslash$Pi{\_}u, A{\^{}}1$\backslash$Sigma{\_}u{\^{}}+ and B{\^{}}1$\backslash$Sigma{\_}u{\^{}}+ states. It creates not only an effective dipole moment allowing free-to-bound transitions near the {\^{}}1S + {\^{}}3P{\_}1 intercombination line but also facilitates bound-to-bound transitions via resonantly coupled excited state rovibrational levels to deeply bound rovibrational levels of the ground X{\^{}}1$\backslash$Sigma{\_}g{\^{}}+ potential, with v" as low as v"=6. The spin-orbit interaction is responsible for both optical pathways. Therefore, those excited state levels that have the largest bound-to-bound transition moments to deeply bound ground state levels also exhibit a sufficient photoassociation probability, comparable to that of the lowest weakly bound excited state level previously observed by Zelevinsky et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 203201 (2006)]. Our study paves the way for an efficient photoassociative production of Sr{\_}2 molecules in ground state levels suitable for experiments testing the electron-to-proton mass ratio.},

The physics of this multi-component Fermi gas turns out to be much richer and more exotic than in the standard SU(2) case. For N{\textgreater}. 2, the phase diagram is quite rich already in the case of the single-band model, including a molecular Luttinger liquid (with dominant superfluid instability in the N-particle channel) for incommensurate fillings, as well as various Mott-insulating phases occurring at commensurate fillings. Particular attention will be paid to the cases with additional orbital degree of freedom (which is accessible experimentally either by taking into account two atomic states or by putting atoms in the p-band levels). We introduce two microscopic models which are relevant for these cases and discuss their symmetries and strong coupling limits. More intriguing phase diagrams are then presented including, for instance, symmetry protected topological phases characterized by non-trivial edge states.},

@article{Javanainen2002,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors relate prehospital delay and in-hospital delay to the incidence of perforation of appendicitis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Quality assurance studies use perforation rate as an index of quality of care. This is based on the assumption commonly presented in retrospective reports that in-hospital delay to surgery influences the incidence of perforation. Only one limited study prospectively found that prehospital delay increased the perforation rate.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: During a 6-month period, 95 consecutive adults undergoing appendectomies at Foothills Hospital in Calgary, Alberta, were questioned as to onset and type of first symptom (i.e., epigastric discomfort, anorexia nervosa, vomiting, and abdominal pain). Time of emergency room (ER) arrival, surgery consultation, and operating room start were taken from the chart. Surgical and pathology reports were used to identify status of appendix (normal, inflamed, suppurative, gangrenous, perforated) and presence of abscess cavity. The status of appendix was related to prehospital and in-hospital delay to establish significance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There were 13 (14{\%}) normal, 67 (70{\%}) inflamed, and 15 (16{\%}) perforated appendices. Patients with perforated appendices waited 2.5 times longer before reporting to the ER, compared with patients with inflamed appendices (57 hours vs. 22 hours, p {\textless} 0.007). Once in the hospital, patients with perforated appendices were identified and treated faster than those with inflamed appendices (7 vs. 9 hours, p {\textless} 0.039). Analysis by ER physician was 3 hours whether the appendix was normal, inflamed, or perforated. Analysis by the surgeon was significantly shorter in patients with perforated appendices than patients with inflamed appendices (4 vs. 6 hours, p {\textless} 0.039).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This prospective study identifies that delay in presentation accounts for the majority of perforated appendices. Clinical evaluation is effective for identifying patients with more advanced disease. Indiscriminate appendectomy as an attempt to decrease perforation is not supported by these data. Hospital perforation rates likely reflect patient factors, illness attitude, and access to medical care.},

abstract = {We investigate the out-of-equilibrium behavior of a dissipative gas of Rydberg atoms that features a dynamical transition between two stationary states characterized by different excitation densities. We determine the structure and properties of the phase diagram and identify the universality class of the transition, both for the statics and the dynamics. We show that the proper dynamical order parameter is in fact not the excitation density and find evidence that the dynamical transition is in the “model ” universality class; i.e., it features a nontrivial symmetry and a dynamics with nonconserved order parameter. This sheds light on some relevant and observable aspects of dynamical transitions in Rydberg gases. In particular it permits a quantitative understanding of a recent experiment [C. Carr, Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 113901 (2013)] which observed bistable behavior as well as power-law scaling of the relaxation time. The latter emerges not due to critical slowing down in the vicinity of a second order transition, but from the nonequilibrium dynamics near a so-called spinodal line.},

@article{Nielsen2009,
abstract = {This note primarily describes the mathematics of least squares regression analysis as it is often used in geodesy including land surveying and satellite positioning applications. In these fields regression is often termed adjustment. The note also contains a couple of typical land surveying and satellite positioning application examples. In these application areas we are typically interested in the parameters in the model typically 2- or 3-D positions and not in predictive modelling which is often the main concern in other regression analysis applications. Adjustment is often used to obtain estimates of relevant parameters in an over-determined system of equations which may arise from deliberately carrying out more measurements than actually needed to determine the set of desired parameters. An example may be the determination of a geographical position based on information from a number of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites also known as space vehicles (SV). It takes at least four SVs to determine the position (and the clock error) of a GNSS receiver. Often more than four SVs are used and we use adjustment to obtain a better estimate of the geographical position (and the clock error) and to obtain estimates of the uncertainty with which the position is determined. Regression analysis is used in many other fields of application both in the natural, the technical and the social sciences. Examples may be curve fitting, calibration, establishing relationships between different variables in an experiment or in a survey, etc. Regression analysis is probably one the most used statistical techniques around. Dr. Anna B. O. Jensen provided insight and data for the Global Positioning System (GPS) example. Matlab code and sections that are considered as either traditional land surveying material or as advanced material are typeset with smaller fonts. Comments in general or on for example unavoidable typos, shortcomings and errors are most welcome.},

@phdthesis{Rey2004,
abstract = {This thesis covers most of my work in the field of ultracold atoms loaded in optical lattices. It makes a route through the physics of cold atoms in periodic potentials starting from the simple noninteracting system and going into the many-body physics that describes the strongly correlated Mott insulator regime. Even though this thesis is a theoreticalwork all the chapters are linked either with experiments already done or with ongoing experimental efforts. This thesis can be divided into four different parts. The first part comprises chapters 1 to 3. In these chapters, after a brief introduction to the field of optical lattices I review the fundamental aspects pertaining to the physics of systems in periodic potentials. The second part deals with the superfluid weakly interacting regime where standard mean field techniques can be applied. This is covered in chapters 4 and 5. Specifically, chapter 4 introduces the discrete nonlinear Schr¨ odinger equation (DNLSE) and uses it to model some experiments. In chapter 5 I go one step further and include the small quantum fluctuations neglected in the DNLSE by studying quadratic approximations of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Chapters 6 to 8 can be grouped as the third part of the thesis. In them I adopt an effective action formalism, the so called two particle irreducible effective action (2PI) together with the closed time path (CTP) formalism to study far-from-equilibrium dynamics. The many-body techniques discussed in these chapters systematically include higher order quantum corrections, not included in the quadratic approxi- mations of the Hamiltonian, which we show are crucial for a correct description of the quantum dynamics outside the very weakly interacting regime. Finally, chapter 9 to 11 are devoted to study the Mott insulator phase. In these chapters using perturbation theory I study the Mott insulator ground state and its excitation spectrum, the response of the system to Bragg spectroscopy, and propose a mechanism to correct for the residual quantum coherences inherent to the Mott insulator ground state. Even though small these are not ideal for the use of neutral atoms in optical lattice as a tool for quantum computation.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a photon-counting technique for detecting Bragg excitation of an ultracold gas of atoms. By measuring the response of the light field to the atoms, we derive a signal independent of traditional time-of-flight atom-imaging techniques. With heterodyne detection we achieve photon shot-noise limited detection of the amplification or depletion of one of the Bragg laser beams. Photon counting for Bragg spectroscopy will be useful for strongly interacting gases where atom-imaging detection fails. In addition, this technique provides the ability to resolve the evolution of excitations as a function of pulse duration.},

Although care must be taken to minimize laser-driven loss processes, we find large ranges of intensities and detunings where useful changes might be affected. Accordingly, we present simple formulas for the effects of laser light that should prove useful in designing specific experiments. We demonstrate the validity of these formulas by comparison with exact close-coupling models. In particular, we find that useful changes of the mean-field interaction require sufficiently high laser intensities that the rate of laser-induced stimulated emission exceeds the natural spontaneous emission rate.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the precise control of ultracold atomic systems have led to the realisation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and degenerate Fermi gases. An important challenge is to extend this level of control to more complicated molecular systems. One route for producing ultracold molecules is to form them from the atoms in a BEC. For example, a two-photon stimulated Raman transition in a Rb-87 BEC has been used to produce Rb-87(2) molecules in a single rotational-vibrational state(1), and ultracold molecules have also been formed(2) through photo-association of a sodium BEC. Although the coherence properties of such systems have not hitherto been probed, the prospect of creating a superposition of atomic and molecular condensates has initiated much theoretical work(3-7). Here we make use of a time-varying magnetic field near a Feshbach resonance(8-12) to produce coherent coupling between atoms and molecules in a Rb-85 BEC. A mixture of atomic and molecular states is created and probed by sudden changes in the magnetic field, which lead to oscillations in the number of atoms that remain in the condensate. The oscillation frequency, measured over a large range of magnetic fields, is in excellent agreement with the theoretical molecular binding energy, indicating that we have created a quantum superposition of atoms and diatomic molecules-two chemically different species.},

abstract = {Superconducting correlations may propagate between two superconductors separated by a tiny insulating or metallic barrier, allowing a dissipationless electric current to flow. In the presence of a magnetic field, the maximum supercurrent oscillates and each oscillation corresponding to the entry of one Josephson vortex into the barrier. Josephson vortices are conceptual blocks of advanced quantum devices such as coherent terahertz generators or qubits for quantum computing, in which on-demand generation and control is crucial. Here, we map superconducting correlations inside proximity Josephson junctions using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Unexpectedly, we find that such Josephson vortices have real cores, in which the proximity gap is locally suppressed and the normal state recovered. By following the Josephson vortex formation and evolution we demonstrate that they originate from quantum interference of Andreev quasiparticles, and that the phase portraits of the two superconducting quantum condensates at edges of the junction decide their generation, shape, spatial extent and arrangement. Our observation opens a pathway towards the generation and control of Josephson vortices by applying supercurrents through the superconducting leads of the junctions, that is, by purely electrical means without any need for a magnetic field, which is a crucial step towards high-density on-chip integration of superconducting quantum devices.},

abstract = {Ultracold atoms in optical lattices have great potential to contribute to a better understanding of some of the most important issues in many-body physics, such as high-{\$}T{\_}c{\$} superconductivity. The Hubbard model describes many of the features shared by the copper oxides, including an interaction-driven Mott insulating state and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. Optical lattices filled with a two-spin-component Fermi gas of ultracold atoms can faithfully realise the Hubbard model with readily tunable parameters, and thus provide a platform for the systematic exploration of its phase diagram. Realisation of strongly correlated phases, however, has been hindered by the need to cool the atoms to temperatures as low as the magnetic exchange energy, and also by the lack of reliable thermometry. Here we demonstrate spin-sensitive Bragg scattering of light to measure AFM spin correlations in a realisation of the 3D Hubbard model at temperatures down to 1.4 times that of the AFM phase transition. This temperature regime is beyond the range of validity of a simple high-temperature series expansion, which brings our experiment close to the limit of the capabilities of current numerical techniques. We reach these low temperatures using a unique compensated optical lattice technique, in which the confinement of each lattice beam is compensated by a blue-detuned laser beam. The temperature of the atoms in the lattice is deduced by comparing the light scattering to determinantal quantum Monte Carlo and numerical linked-cluster expansion calculations. Further refinement of the compensated lattice may produce even lower temperatures which, along with light scattering thermometry, would open avenues for achieving and characterising other novel quantum states of matter, such as the pseudogap regime of the 2D Hubbard model.},

abstract = {We observe large-amplitude Rabi oscillations between an atomic and a molecular state near a Feshbach resonance. The experiment uses 87Rb in an optical lattice and a Feshbach resonance near 414 G. The frequency and amplitude of the oscillations depend on magnetic field in a way that is well described by a two-level model. The observed density dependence of the oscillation frequency agrees with the theoretical expectation. We confirmed that the state produced after a half-cycle contains exactly one molecule at each lattice site. In addition, we show that for energies in a gap of the lattice band structure, the molecules cannot dissociate.},

abstract = {Since their first experimental observation, ultralong-range Rydberg molecules consisting of a highly excited Rydberg atom and a ground state atom have attracted the interest in the field of ultracold chemistry. Especially the intriguing properties like size, polarizability and type of binding they inherit from the Rydberg atom are of interest. An open question in the field is the reduced lifetime of the molecules compared to the corresponding atomic Rydberg states. In this letter we present an experimental study on the lifetimes of the {\^{}}3$\backslash$Sigma (5s-35s) molecule in its vibrational ground state and in an excited state. We show that the lifetimes depends on the density of ground state atoms and that this can be described in the frame of a classical scattering between the molecules and ground state atoms. We also find that the excited molecular state has an even more reduced lifetime compared to the ground state which can be attributed to an inward penetration of the bound atomic pair due to imperfect quantum reflection that takes place in the special shape of the molecular potential.},

abstract = {In a solid material strong interactions between the electrons can lead to surprising properties. A prime example is the Mott insulator, where the suppression of conductivity is a result of interactions and not the consequence of a filled Bloch band. The proximity to the Mott insulating phase in fermionic systems is the origin for many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics, most notably high-temperature superconductivity. Therefore it is highly desirable to use the novel experimental tools developed in atomic physics to access this regime. Indeed, the Hubbard model, which encompasses the essential physics of the Mott insulator, also applies to quantum gases trapped in an optical lattice. However, the Mott insulating regime has so far been reached only with a gas of bosons, lacking the rich and peculiar nature of fermions. Here we report on the formation of a Mott insulator of a repulsively interacting two-component Fermi gas in an optical lattice. It is signalled by three features: a drastic suppression of doubly occupied lattice sites, a strong reduction of the compressibility inferred from the response of double occupancy to atom number increase, and the appearance of a gapped mode in the excitation spectrum. Direct control of the interaction strength allows us to compare the Mott insulating and the non-interacting regime without changing tunnel-coupling or confinement. Our results pave the way for further studies of the Mott insulator, including spin ordering and ultimately the question of d-wave superfluidity.},

abstract = {Abstract Skin-pass rolling is a substantial process step in the production line of sheet material for automotive applications. Textured rolls are used to emboss an immaterial surface structure on sheets for improving their formability in subsequent deep drawing operations. In this paper, state of the art techniques for texturing skin-pass rolls are discussed in order to assess their ability to meet optimal tribological parameters. Two main problems are identified: firstly, structured rolls are affected by ongoing wear limiting the operating time and necessitates perpetual maintenance. Secondly, state of the art techniques are not able to exploit the theoretically known potential of immaterial surface structures for enabling micro-lubrication mechanisms due to geometrical inadequacies. Based on these findings, a new approach for texturing of skin-pass rolls is introduced. The technique uses a localised dispersing of hard ceramic particles by use of pulsed laser radiation. It is shown in this paper that this technique allows the creation of elevated structures with high hardness on the surface of 1.2379 cold-working steel. The wear behaviour of such textured rolls was investigated in a lubricated twin-disc-test. The experiments show that no significant wear of the laser produced structures occur during the test duration. The observed results lead to the assumption that the proposed technique allows the creation of skin-pass roll structures with significantly higher durability.},

We create a BEC of 84-Sr exceeding 10{\^{}}7 atoms, which is a 30-fold improvement over previously reported experiments. We increase the atom number of 86-Sr BECs to 2.5x10{\^{}}4 (a fivefold improvement), and refine the generation of attractively interacting 88-Sr BECs. We present a scheme to generate 84-Sr BECs with a cycle time of 2s, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the shortest cycle time of BEC experiments ever reported. We create deeply-degenerate 87-Sr Fermi gases with T/T{\_}F as low as 0.10(1), where the number of populated nuclear spin states can be set to any value between one and ten. Furthermore, we report on a total of five different double-degenerate Bose-Bose and Bose-Fermi mixtures.

Precision spectroscopy of ultracold neutral atoms confined in a trapping potential now shows superior optical coherence without any deleterious effects from motional degrees of freedom, revealing optical resonance linewidths at the hertz level with a good signal-to-noise ratio. The resonance quality factor of 2.4 x 10(14) is the highest ever recovered in any form of coherent spectroscopy. The spectral resolution permits direct observation of the breaking of nuclear spin degeneracy for the 1S0 and 3P0 optical clock states of 87Sr under a small magnetic bias field. This optical approach for excitation of nuclear spin states allows an accurate measurement of the differential Land{\'{e}} g factor between 1S0 and 3P0. The optical atomic coherence demonstrated for collective excitation of a large number of atoms will have a strong impact on quantum measurement and precision frequency metrology.},

This approach provides a route to strongly-correlated phases of lattice gases that are beyond the reach of previously proposed dissipative three-body interactions. In particular, we study the mean-field phase diagram for spinless bosons with three- and two- body interactions, and provide a roadmap to dimer states of varying character in 1D. This new toolset should be immediately applicable in state-of-the-art cold atom experiments.},

abstract = {Blockade effects on the single quantum level are at the heart of quantum devices like single-electron transistors. The blockade mechanisms are based on strong interactions like the Coulomb interaction in case of single electrons. Neutral atoms excited into a Rydberg state experience abnormally strong interactions that lead to the corresponding blockade effect for Rydberg atoms. In this paper we report on our measurements of a strong van der Waals blockade, showing that only one out of several thousand atoms within a blockade volume can be excited. In addition, our experimental results demonstrate the coherent nature of the excitation of magnetically trapped ultracold atoms into a Rydberg state, confirming the predicted dependence of the collective Rabi frequency on the square root of the mesoscopic system size. This collective coherent behaviour is generic for all mesoscopic systems which are able to carry only one single excitation quantum.},

abstract = {A method is developed for calculating the effects of a strong oscillating field on two states of a quantum-mechanical system which are connected by a matrix element of the field. Explicit approximate solutions are obtained for a variety of special cases, and the results of numerical computations are given for others. The effect of an rf field on the J=2→1 l-type doublet microwave absorption lines of OCS has been studied in particular both experimentally and theoretically. Each line was observed to split into two components when the frequency of the rf field was near 12.78 Mc or 38.28 Mc, which are the frequencies separating the J=1 and J=2 pairs of levels, respectively. By measuring the rf frequency, $\nu$0, at which the microwave lines are split into two equally intense components, one may determine the separation between the energy levels. The measured value of $\nu$0 depends upon the intensity of the rf field and the form of this dependence has been calculated and found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.},

abstract = {Fermionic alkaline-earth atoms have unique properties that make them attractive candidates for the realization of novel atomic clocks and degenerate quantum gases. At the same time, they are attracting considerable theoretical attention in the context of quantum information processing. Here we demonstrate that when such atoms are loaded in optical lattices, they can be used as quantum simulators of unique many-body phenomena. In particular, we show that the decoupling of the nuclear spin from the electronic angular momentum can be used to implement many-body systems with an unprecedented degree of symmetry, characterized by the SU(N) group with N as large as 10. Moreover, the interplay of the nuclear spin with the electronic degree of freedom provided by a stable optically excited state allows for the study of spin-orbital physics. Such systems may provide valuable insights into strongly correlated physics of transition metal oxides, heavy fermion materials, and spin liquid phases.},

abstract = {In the experimental context of cold-fermion optical lattices, we discuss the possibilities to approach the pseudogap or ordered phases by manipulating the scattering length or the strength of the laser-induced lattice potential. Using the Two-Particle Self-Consistent Approach as well as Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide isentropic curves for the two- and three-dimensional Hubbard models at half-filling. These quantitative results are important for practical attempts to reach the ordered antiferromagnetic phase in experiments on optical lattices of two-component fermions. We find that adiabatically turning on the interaction in two dimensions to cool the system is not very effective. In three dimensions, adiabatic cooling to the antiferromagnetic phase can be achieved in such a manner although the cooling efficiency is not as high as initially suggested by Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. Adiabatic cooling by turning off the repulsion beginning at strong coupling is possible in certain cases.},

We describe one such technique in which a probe field experiences a large index of refraction with amplification rather than absorption, and examine its practicality for an immersion lithography application. Enhanced index can be observed in a three-level system with a tunable, near-resonant, coherent probe and incoherent pump field that inverts population of the probe transition. This observation contradicts the common belief that large indices of refraction are impossible without absorption, however it is well in accord with existing electromagnetic theory and practice. Calculations show that a refractive index {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 2 is possible with practical experimental parameters. A scheme with an incoherent mixture of pumped and unpumped atoms is also examined, and is seen to have a lower refractive index ({\~{}}2) accompanied by neither gain nor loss.},

abstract = {Clocks based on optical transitions in ions and atoms are quickly moving to the forefront of the frequency standards field mainly because of the high spec- tral resolution, and therefore the potential stability and accuracy, which can be achieved. In this thesis a new optical clock based on neutral atoms trapped in an optical lattice is presented, demonstrating spectroscopy of the clock transition free of any lineshape or accuracy degradation due to atomic motion. The system simu- lates a single trapped ion clock, but allows use of thousands of atoms for improved signal to noise ratio, and clock stability. High accuracy can also be achieved as the lattice can be designed to shift the energy of the two atomic clock states equally, such that the transition frequency is unchanged. Strontium is a natural candidate for such a clock as it offers an extremely narrow optical transition (∼1 mHz) based on atomic states which are very insensitive to external fields. The strontium level structure allows efficient laser cooling to 1 µK with diode laser sources, and a con- venient wavelength of 813 nm for the zero-differential Stark shift optical lattice. The strontium lattice clock system has allowed observation of high signal-to-noise spectral features with the largest line quality factor ever observed in coherent spectroscopy (Q {\textgreater} 2×1014), attesting to the stability of the clock. The effects of nuclear spin in the Sr isotope used are explored in how it pertains to the potential accuracy of the clock. The clock accuracy is evaluated at a fractional level of 9×10−16, representing the first time a neutral atom optical clock has reached an accuracy comparable to the primary Cs fountains. The optical frequency is then measured using a fs-comb referenced to the NIST Cs standard via a calibrated hydrogen maser. The final frequency value of 429,228,004,229,874.0(1.1) Hz is in excellent agreement with other measurements from labs around the world, and represents one of the most accurate optical frequency measurements to date.},

In simple terms, the quantum Zeno effect refers to a slowing down of the evolution of a quantum state in the limit that the state is observed continuously. There has been much disagreement as to how the quantum Zeno effect should be defined and as to whether it is really a paradox, requiring new physics, or merely a consequence of "ordinary" quantum mechanics. The experiment of Itano, Heinzen, Bollinger, and Wineland, published in 1990, has been cited around 347 times and seems to be the one most often called a demonstration of the quantum Zeno effect. Given that there is disagreement as to what the quantum Zeno effect is, there naturally is disagreement as to whether that experiment demonstrated the quantum Zeno effect. Some differing perspectives regarding the quantum Zeno effect and what would constitute an experimental demonstration are discussed.},

abstract = {Coherent preparation by laser light of quantum states of atoms and molecules can lead to quantum interference in the amplitudes of optical transitions. In this way the optical properties of a medium can be dramatically modified, leading to electromagnetically induced transparency and related effects, which have placed gas-phase systems at the center of recent advances in the development of media with radically new optical properties. This article reviews these advances and the new possibilities they offer for nonlinear optics and quantum information science. As a basis for the theory of electromagnetically induced transparency the authors consider the atomic dynamics and the optical response of the medium to a continuous-wave laser. They then discuss pulse propagation and the adiabatic evolution of field-coupled states and show how coherently prepared media can be used to improve frequency conversion in nonlinear optical mixing experiments. The extension of these concepts to very weak optical fields in the few-photon limit is then examined. The review concludes with a discussion of future prospects and potential new applications.},

Simple resonant scattering theory, illustrated by the example of 40Ca, allows an estimate of the magnitude of the effect. Unlike alkali metal species, large changes of the scattering length are possible while atom loss remains small, because of the very narrow line width of the molecular photoassociation transition. This raises prospects for control of atomic interactions for a system without magnetically tunable Feshbach resonance levels.},

We studied the predictive value of the MRI-derived volumes of medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures, white matter lesions (WML), neuropsychological tests, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on conversion of MCI to dementia and AD. The study included 60 subjects with MCI identified from population cohorts. During the mean follow-up period of 34 months, 13 patients had progressed to dementia (9 to Alzheimer's disease (AD)). In Cox regression analysis the baseline volumes of the right hippocampus, the right entorhinal cortex and CDR sum of boxes predicted the progression of MCI to dementia during the follow-up. In a bivariate analysis, only the baseline volumes of entorhinal cortex predicted conversion of MCI to AD. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at baseline, WML load, or APOE genotype were not significant predictors of progression. The MTL volumetry helps in identifying among the MCI subjects a group, which is at high risk for developing AD. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We describe several routes to quantum degenerate gases based on simple schemes to efficiently load atoms into and evaporate them from a "dimple" crossed dipolar trap. The dimple is loaded nonadiabatically by collisions between atoms which are trapped in a reservoir which can be provided either by a dark spontaneous-force magneto-optical trap (MOT), the (aberrated) laser beam itself, or by a quadrupolar or quadratic magnetic trap. Optimal loading parameters for the dimple, relatively high temperature, and tight optical trap are derived from thermodynamic equations including possible inelastic and Majorana losses. Evaporative cooling is described by a set of simple equations, taking into account gravity, the possible occurrence of the hydrodynamical regime, Feshbach resonances, and three body recombination. The solution implies that to have efficient evaporation the elastic collisional rate (in s(-1)) must be on the order of the trap frequency and lower than 100 times the temperature in microkelvins. Following this approach Bose-Einstein condensates with more than 10(7) atoms should be obtained in much less than 1 s starting from an ordinary MOT setup.},

abstract = {The strong interaction between Rydberg atoms can be used to control the strength and character of the interatomic interaction in ultracold gases by weakly dressing the atoms with a Rydberg state. Elaborate theoretical proposals for the realization of various complex phases and applications in quantum simulation exist. Also a simple model has been already developed that describes the basic idea of Rydberg dressing in a two-atom basis. However, an experimental realization has been elusive so far. We present a model describing the ground state of a Bose-Einstein condensate dressed with a Rydberg level based on the Rydberg blockade. This approach provides an intuitive understanding of the transition from pure twobody interaction to a regime of collective interactions. Furthermore it enables us to calculate the deformation of a three-dimensional sample under realistic experimental conditions in mean-field approximation. We compare full three-dimensional numerical calculations of the ground state to an analytic expression obtained within Thomas-Fermi approximation. Finally we discuss limitations and problems arising in an experimental realization of Rydberg dressing based on our experimental results. Our work enables the reader to straight forwardly estimate the experimental feasibility of Rydberg dressing in realistic three-dimensional atomic samples.},

abstract = {We investigate the computational power of creating steady-states of quantum dissipative systems whose evolution is governed by time-independent and local couplings to a memoryless environment. We show that such a model allows for efficient universal quantum computation with the result of the computation encoded in the steady state. Due to the purely dissipative nature of the process, this way of doing quantum computation exhibits some inherent robustness and defies some of the DiVincenzo criteria for quantum computation. We show that there is a natural class of problems that can be solved with such a model - the preparation of ground states of frustration free quantum Hamiltonians. This allows for robust and efficient creation of exotic states that exhibit features like topological quantum order and the creation of PEPS and it proves the existence of novel dissipative phase transitions. In particular the latter can in principle be verified experimentally with present day technology such as with optical lattices.},

Here a¯=cos[$\pi$/(n-2)]{\{} √2M$\alpha$ /[ħ(n-2)]{\}}2/(n-2)[$\Gamma$(n-3)/(n-2)]/[T(n-1)/(n-2)] is the mean scattering length determined by the asymptotic behavior of the potential U(r)∼-$\alpha$/Rn, (n=6 for atom-atom scattering or n=4 for ion-atom scattering), M is the reduced mass of the atoms, and $\Phi$ is the semiclassical phase calculated at zero energy from the classical turning point to infinity. The value of a¯, the average scattering length, also determines the slope of the s-wave phase shifts beyond the near-threshold region. The formula is applicable to the collisions of atoms cooled down in traps, where the scattering length determines the character of the atom-atom interaction. Our calculation shows that repulsion between atoms (a{\textgreater}0) is more likely than attraction with a ‘‘probability'' of 75{\%}. For the Cs-Cs scattering in the 3$\Sigma$u state, a¯=95.5aB has been obtained, where aB is the Bohr radius. The comparison of the calculated cross-section energy dependence with the experimental data gives evidence for a positive value for the Cs-Cs scattering length, which makes cesium Bose gas stable.},

Rydberg enabled capabilities include long-range two-qubit gates, collective encoding of multi-qubit registers, implementation of robust light-atom quantum interfaces, and the potential for simulating quantum many body physics.

abstract = {Rydberg atoms have an electron in a state with a very high principal quantum number, and as a result can exhibit unusually long-range interactions. One example is the bonding of two such atoms by multipole forces to form Rydberg-Rydberg molecules with very large internuclear distances. Notably, bonding interactions can also arise from the low-energy scattering of a Rydberg electron with negative scattering length from a ground-state atom. In this case, the scattering-induced attractive interaction binds the ground-state atom to the Rydberg atom at a well-localized position within the Rydberg electron wavefunction and thereby yields giant molecules that can have internuclear separations of several thousand Bohr radii. Here we report the spectroscopic characterization of such exotic molecular states formed by rubidium Rydberg atoms that are in the spherically symmetric s state and have principal quantum numbers, n, between 34 and 40. We find that the spectra of the vibrational ground state and of the first excited state of the Rydberg molecule, the rubidium dimer Rb(5s)-Rb(ns), agree well with simple model predictions. The data allow us to extract the s-wave scattering length for scattering between the Rydberg electron and the ground-state atom, Rb(5s), in the low-energy regime (kinetic energy, {\textless}100 meV), and to determine the lifetimes and the polarizabilities of the Rydberg molecules. Given our successful characterization of s-wave bound Rydberg states, we anticipate that p-wave bound states, trimer states and bound states involving a Rydberg electron with large angular momentum-so-called trilobite molecules-will also be realized and directly probed in the near future.},

abstract = {Controlling strongly interacting many-body systems enables the creation of tailored quantum matter, with properties transcending those based solely on single particle physics. Atomic ensembles which are optically driven to a Rydberg state provide many examples of this, such as atom-atom entanglement, many-body Rabi oscillations, strong photon-photon interaction and spatial pair correlations. In its most basic form, Rydberg quantum matter consists of an isolated ensemble of strongly interacting atoms spatially confined to the blockade volume - a so-called superatom. Here we demonstrate the controlled creation and characterization of an isolated mesoscopic superatom by means of accurate density engineering and excitation to Rydberg {\$}p{\$}-states. Its variable size allows to investigate the transition from effective two-level physics for strong confinement to many-body phenomena in extended systems. By monitoring continuous laser-induced ionization we observe a strongly anti-bunched ion emission under blockade conditions and extremely bunched ion emission under off-resonant excitation. Our experimental setup enables in vivo measurements of the superatom, yielding insight into both excitation statistics and dynamics. We anticipate straightforward applications in quantum optics and quantum information as well as future experiments on many-body physics.},

abstract = {Throughout physics, stable composite objects are usually formed via attractive forces, which allow the constituents to lower their energy by binding together. Repulsive forces separate particles in free space. However, in a structured environment such as a periodic potential and in the absence of dissipation, stable composite objects can exist even for repulsive interactions. Here we report on the first observation of such an exotic bound state, comprised of a pair of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. Consistent with our theoretical analysis, these repulsively bound pairs exhibit long lifetimes, even under collisions with one another. Signatures of the pairs are also recognised in the characteristic momentum distribution and through spectroscopic measurements. There is no analogue in traditional condensed matter systems of such repulsively bound pairs, due to the presence of strong decay channels. These results exemplify on a new level the strong correspondence between the optical lattice physics of ultracold bosonic atoms and the Bose-Hubbard model, a correspondence which is vital for future applications of these systems to the study of strongly correlated condensed matter systems and to quantum information.},

Bosons in periodic potentials (e.g., on a lattice) at T=0 exhibit two types of phases: a superfluid phase and Mott insulating phases characterized by integer (or commensurate) boson densities, by the existence of a gap for particle-hole excitations, and by zero compressibility. Generically, the superfluid onset transition in d dimensions from a Mott insulator to superfluidity is ‘‘ideal,'' or mean field in character, but at special multicritical points with particle-hole symmetry it is in the universality class of the (d+1)-dimensional XY model. In the presence of disorder, a third, ‘‘Bose glass'' phase exists. This phase is insulating because of the localization effects of the randomness and analogous to the Fermi glass phase of interacting fermions in a strongly disordered potential.},

abstract = {We report on the attainment of a spin-polarized Fermi sea of 87 Sr in thermal contact with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of 84 Sr. Interisotope collisions thermalize the fermions with the bosons during evaporative cooling. A degeneracy with T /T F = 0.30(5) is reached for a 87 Sr Fermi sea of 2 × 10 4 atoms together with an almost pure 84 Sr BEC of 10 5 atoms. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevA.82.011608 PACS number(s): 67.85.Hj, 37.10.De, 03.75.Ss Groundbreaking experiments with ultracold Fermi gases [1,2] have opened possibilities to study fascinating phenom-ena, such as the BCS-BEC crossover, with a high degree of control. Most experiments have been performed with the two alkali-metal fermions 40 K and 6 Li. Fermions with two valence electrons, such as 43 Ca, 87 Sr, 171 Yb, and 173 Yb, have a much richer internal state structure, which is at the heart of recent proposals for quantum computation and simulation [3–9]. Unlike bosonic isotopes of these elements, the fermions have a nuclear spin, which decouples from the electronic state in the 1 S 0 ground state. This gives rise to a SU(N) spin symmetry, where N is the number of nuclear spin states, which is 10 for 87 Sr. This symmetry can lead to new quantum phases in optical lattices [3–6] such as the chiral spin liquid. Non-Abelian gauge potentials can be realized by engineering state-dependent lattices [7]. In addition, the nuclear spin can be used to robustly store quantum information, which can be manipulated using the electronic structure [8,9]. Double-degenerate Bose-Fermi mixtures extend the possibilities even further, allowing the study of phase separation and the effects of mediated interactions. Evaporative cooling of ultracold atoms to quantum degen-eracy relies on elastic collisions to thermalize the sample. Identical fermions do not collide at low temperatures; therefore mixtures of spins [10–14], isotopes [15–17], or elements [18–20] are used for evaporation. 87 Sr has a large nuclear spin of I = 9/2, which leads to a 10-fold degenerate ground state. Recently, 87 Sr in a mixture of these states was cooled to quantum degeneracy [13]. In this Rapid Communication, we report on the attainment of a spin-polarized quantum degenerate Fermi gas of 87 Sr together with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of 84 Sr. Interisotope collisions are used to thermalize the fermions with the bosons. The system provides a clean starting point for the exploration of alkaline-earth Bose-Fermi mixtures. Our scheme to generate a BEC of 84 Sr is described in Ref. [21]. We have extended this scheme to the preparation of Bose-Fermi mixtures. In the following, we briefly summa-rize the basic preparation steps, while technical details will be presented elsewhere [22]. We take advantage of atoms in the metastable 5s5p 3 P 2 state that can be trapped in the quadrupole magnetic field of the magneto-optical trap (MOT). These atoms are automatically produced when operating a " blue MOT " on the 5s 2 1 S 0 -5s5p 1 P 1 transition at a wave-length of 461 nm. The 461 nm laser system is initially tuned to the 84 Sr line, and metastable-state bosons are accumulated in the magnetic trap. After 5 s, the laser frequency is shifted by 210 MHz to the 87 Sr line, and metastable-state fermions are added to the magnetic trap for another 6 s [23]. Further cooling and density increase of the mixture is achieved by operating " red MOTs " for each isotope simul-taneously on the 7.4 kHz linewidth 1 S 0 -3 P 1 intercombination lines at 689 nm. Since 87 Sr has a nuclear spin, its 3 P 1 state is split into three hyperfine states with F},

Comparison between the predictions of the new models and those of previous empirical and $\backslash$emph{\{}ab initio{\}} studies reveals good agreement with most series, however some discrepancies are highlighted. Using the multichannel quantum defect theory wave functions derived from our models we calculate other observables such as Land$\backslash$'e {\$}g{\_}J{\$}-factors and radiative lifetimes.

We present the technique of short Bragg pulses, which stimulates the standing wave. The subsequent oscillations are observed in situ. The frequency of the oscillations gives the dispersion relation, the amplitude gives the static structure factor, and the decay gives the dephasing time. The new technique gives orders of magnitude more sensitivity than Bragg spectroscopy, allowing for the observation of deviations from the local density approximation. Specifically, it is seen that the phonons undergo a transition from three dimensions to one dimension, when their wavelength becomes longer than the transverse radius of the condensate. The one-dimensional regime contains an inflection point in the dispersion relation, a decrease in the superfluid critical velocity, a minimum in the group velocity, and an increase in the lifetime of the standing wave oscillations.},

abstract = {In this thesis I report on experiments that enter a new regime in the many body physics of ultracold atomic gases. A Bose-Einstein condensate is loaded into a three-dimensional optical lattice potential formed by a standing wave laser light field. In this novel quantum system we have been able to both realize a quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a Mott insulator, and to observe the collapse and revival of a macroscopic matter wave field. Quantum phase transitions are driven by quantum fluctuations and occur, even at zero temperature, as the relative strength of two competing energy terms in the underlying Hamiltonian is varied across a critical value. In the first part of this work I report on the observation of such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. In the superfluid ground state, each atom is spread-out over the entire lattice, whereas in the Mott insulating state, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites. We observed the reversible transition between those states and detected the gap in the excitation spectrum of the Mott insulator. A Bose-Einstein condensate is usually described by a macroscopic matter wave field. However, a quantized field underlies such a "classical" matter wave field of a Bose-Einstein condensate. The striking behavior of ultracold matter due to the field quantization and the nonlinear interactions between the atoms is the focus of the second part of this work. The matter wave field of a Bose-Einstein condensate is observed to undergo a series of collapses and revivals as time evolves. Furthermore, we show that the collisions between individual pairs of atoms lead to a fully coherent collisional phase shift in the corresponding many-particle state, which is a crucial cornerstone of proposed novel quantum computation schemes with neutral atoms. With these experiments we enter a new field of physics with ultracold quantum gases. In this strongly correlated regime, interactions between atoms dominate the behavior of the many-body system such that it can no longer be described by the usual theories for weakly interacting Bose gases. This novel quantum system offers the unique possibility to experimentally address fundamental questions of modern solid state physics, atomic physics, quantum optics, and quantum information.},

abstract = {We investigate theoretically the suppression of two-body losses when the on-site loss rate is larger than all other energy scales in a lattice. This work quantitatively explains the recently observed suppression of chemical reactions between two rotational states of fermionic KRb molecules confined in one-dimensional tubes with a weak lattice along the tubes [Yan et al., Nature (London) 501, 521 (2013)]. New loss rate measurements performed for different lattice parameters but under controlled initial conditions allow us to show that the loss suppression is a consequence of the combined effects of lattice confinement and the continuous quantum Zeno effect. A key finding, relevant for generic strongly reactive systems, is that while a single-band theory can qualitatively describe the data, a quantitative analysis must include multiband effects. Accounting for these effects reduces the inferred molecule filling fraction by a factor of 5. A rate equation can describe much of the data, but to properly reproduce the loss dynamics with a fixed filling fraction for all lattice parameters we develop a mean-field model and benchmark it with numerically exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group calculations.},

@article{Gagen1993,
abstract = {We present a model of continuous (in time) position measurements on a quantum system using a single pseudoclassical meter. The nonselective evolution of the system is described by a master equation which is identical to that obtained from previous models. The selective evolution is described by a stochastic nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. The significance of this equation is that the stochastic term has a physical interpretaion. By carefully choosing the parameters which define the meter and the system-meter coupling, we obtain a meter pointer with well-defined position which undergoes fluctuations. This ‘‘jitter'' in the pointer position gives rise to the stochastic dynamical collapse of the system wave function. By the inclusion of feedback on the meter, the pointer is made to relax towards an appropriate readout. We apply this model to the selective measurement of the position of a particle in a double-well potential. In contrast to a recent claim [H. Fearn and W. E. Lamb, Jr., Phys. Rev. A 46, 1199 (1992)] we show that truly continuous position measurements lead to a quantum Zeno effect in certain parameter regimes. This is manifest by the changing of the particle dynamics from coherent tunneling between the well minima to incoherent flipping, as in a random telegraph. As the measurement strength increases, the average length of time the particle remains stuck in one well increases proportionally.},

We contrast the relaxation dynamics of this class of systems with those evolving via classical rate equations towards a stationary state with the same values of diagonal or "classical" observables as in the quantum system but where coherences are absent. We focus in particular on spin systems whose dynamics becomes correlated and complex due to dynamical constraints, inspired by kinetically constrained models (KCMs) of classical glasses. We show that in the quantum case the relaxation of the coherences can be orders of magnitude slower than that of diagonal observables. Finally, we show that the relaxation of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions can indeed, in an appropriate limit, be described by such a purely dissipative dynamics with non-classical jump operators. We establish a connection between the Rydberg system and the discussed KCMs and investigate the limitations of using a classical rate equation model to capture the non-equilibrium behaviour of this system.},

@article{Naidon2006,
abstract = {In this paper we formulate the time-dependent many-body theory of photoassociation in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate with realistic interatomic interactions, using and comparing two approximations: the first-order cumulant approximation, originally developed by Kohler and Burnett [Phys. Rev. A 65, 033601 (2002)], and the reduced pair wave approximation, based on a previous paper [Phys. Rev. A 68 033612 (2003)] generalizing to two channels the Cherny-Shanenko approach [Phys. Rev. E 62, 1046 (2000)]. The two approximations differ only by the way a pair of condensate atoms is influenced by the mean field at short interatomic separations. For these approximations we identify two different regimes of photoassociation: the adiabatic regime and the coherent regime. The threshold for the so-called "rogue dissociation" [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 090403 (2002)] (where mean-field theory breaks down) is found to be different in each regime, which sheds new light on the experiment of McKenzie et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 120403 (2002)] and previous theoretical calculations. We then use the two approximations to investigate numerically the effects of rogue dissociation in a sodium condensate under conditions similar to the McKenzie et al experiment. We find two different effects: reduction of the photoassociation rate at short times, and creation of correlated pairs of atoms, confirming previous works. We also observe that the photoassociation line shapes become asymmetric in the first-order cumulant approximation, while they remain symmetric in the reduced pair wave approximation, giving the possibility to experimentally distinguish between the two approximations.},

abstract = {We report photoassociation spectroscopy of ultracold {\$}{\^{}}{\{}86{\}}{\$}Sr atoms near the intercombination line and provide theoretical models to describe the obtained bound state energies. We show that using only the molecular states correlating with the {\$}{\^{}}1S{\_}0{\$}{\$}+{\$}{\$}{\^{}}3P{\_}1{\$} asymptote is insufficient to provide a mass scaled theoretical model that would reproduce the bound state energies for all isotopes investigated to date: {\$}{\^{}}{\{}84{\}}{\$}Sr, {\$}{\^{}}{\{}86{\}}{\$}Sr and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}88{\}}{\$}Sr. We attribute that to the recently discovered avoided crossing between the {\$}{\^{}}1S{\_}0{\$}{\$}+{\$}{\$}{\^{}}3P{\_}1{\$} {\$}0{\_}u{\^{}}+{\$} ({\$}{\^{}}3\backslashPi{\_}u{\$}) and {\$}{\^{}}1S{\_}0{\$}{\$}+{\$}{\$}{\^{}}1D{\_}2{\$} {\$}0{\_}u{\^{}}+{\$} ({\$}{\^{}}1\backslashSigma{\^{}}+{\_}u{\$}) potential curves at short range and we build a mass scaled interaction model that quantitatively reproduces the available {\$}0{\_}u{\^{}}+{\$} and {\$}1{\_}u{\$} bound state energies for the three stable bosonic isotopes. We also provide isotope-specific two-channel models that incorporate the rotational (Coriolis) mixing between the {\$}0{\_}u{\^{}}+{\$} and {\$}1{\_}u{\$} curves which, while not mass scaled, are capable of quantitatively describing the vibrational splittings observed in experiment. We find that the use of state-of-the-art ab initio potential curves significantly improves the quantitative description of the Coriolis mixing between the two -8 GHz bound states in {\$}{\^{}}{\{}88{\}}{\$}Sr over the previously used model potentials. We show that one of the recently reported energy levels in {\$}{\^{}}{\{}84{\}}{\$}Sr does not follow the long range bound state series and theorize on the possible causes.

Using artificial gauge fields induced by laser-assisted tunneling, we realize arrays of decoupled ladder systems that are exposed to a uniform magnetic field. By suddenly decoupling the ladders and projecting into isolated double wells, we are able to measure the currents on each side of the ladder. For large coupling strengths along the rungs of the ladder, we find a saturated maximum chiral current corresponding to a full screening of the artificial magnetic field. For lower coupling strengths, the chiral current decreases in good agreement with expectations of a vortex lattice phase.

A change of the rotational assignment by four units compared to an earlier work (G. Gerber, R. M$\backslash$"oller, and H. Schneider, J. Chem. Phys. 81, 1538 (1984)) is needed for a consistent description leading to a significant shift of the potentials towards longer inter atomic distances.

The presented ground state potential is derived from the observed transitions for the radial region from 4 to 11 A (9 cm-1 below the asymptote) and is extended to the longe range region by the use of theoretical dispersion coefficients together with already available photoassociation data. New estimations of the scattering lengths for the complete set of isotopic combinations are derived by mass scaling with the derived potential. The data set for the excited state 2{\_}1Sigma+u was sufficient to derive a potential energy curve around the minimum.},

@article{DeSalvo2015Thesis,
abstract = {This dissertation describes experiments on two-photon excitation of ultracold Sr to the 3 S 1 Rydberg series and represents the first experiments exciting Rydberg atoms via an intermediate triplet excited state. Due to the narrow linewidth (7.5 kHz) of the 1 S 0 → 3 P 1 transition in Sr, this excitation scheme yields longer coherence times and less loss from the intermediate state compared to methods using the usual dipole allowed transitions. This is advantageous for realizing the possibility of Rydberg dressing, where a small amount of Rydberg character is admixed to ground state atoms allowing for continuously tunable long-range interactions. With this goal in mind, we explore the interplay of Rydberg blockade, Rydberg-Rydberg interactions, and ground-Rydberg interactions in high density, ultracold gases through Autler-Townes spectroscopy and photoassociation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules. First, we study ultra-long range Sr 2 Rydberg molecules comprising one Rydberg atom and one ground-state atom. Molecules are photo-associated from an optically trapped thermal gas of 84 Sr with lasers far-off resonance from the intermediate state and red-detuned from the atomic transition. The formation of molecules is detected as atom loss and the narrow spectroscopic features allow accurate determination of molecular binding energies as a function of principal quantum number. Comparison to theory yields good agreement and allows the first precision measurement of the electron-Sr scattering length. We then explore the density-dependent atomic photo-excitation line shapes in a thermal gas of 84 Sr in an EIT configuration in the Autler-Townes regime. This is a promising configuration for Rydberg dressing. In this configuration we find fast loss due to Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in the form of energy level shifts and dephasing. To describe these effects, we employ a modified mean-field treatment taking in the effects of correlations and are able to capture the early time dynamics of the spectra. Finally, we propose a method to detect Rydberg dressing in a BEC via low momen-tum transfer Bragg spectroscopy. We show preliminary results showing the sensitivity of this technique as well as calculations of the expected signal that it would detect.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} EM International. In this paper, we reported a method to detect the presence of Pb and Cu in aquatic environment using two types of photosynthetic pigments in cyanobacteria Anabaena cylindrica (Wong) chlorophylls and carotenoids as reporters. The detection was based on the reduction of chlorophylls and carotenoids in the presence of the heavy metals, while the changes were captured using spectrophotometer with {\"{e}} = 440 nm and 640 nm respectively. Using cells from lag phase and the exposure time of 24 hours, the changes of both pigments were recorded after the cells were exposed to 0.01 mg/L, 0.10 mg/L, 1.00 mg/L, and 10.00 mg/L of Pb and Cu respectively. The results showed the optical densities (OD) which are corresponding to the concentration of chlorophylls and carotenoids in cyanobacteria were well-correlated to the change of heavy metals concentrations. Then, we demonstrated that the correlation between the concentration changes of the pigments to heavy metals and the sensitivity of the detection could be enhanced with simple modelling. Thus, we concluded that both chlorophyll and carotenoids in A. cylindrica could be used as bio-reporters for Pb and Cu detection, while modelling of the responses could be an alternative to enhance the sensitivity of the detection.},

abstract = {The Hubbard model, containing only the minimum ingredients of nearest neighbor hopping and on-site interaction for correlated electrons, has succeeded in accounting for diverse phenomena observed in solid-state materials. One of the interesting extensions is to enlarge its spin symmetry to SU(N{\textgreater}2), which is closely related to systems with orbital degeneracy. Here we report a successful formation of the SU(6) symmetric Mott insulator state with an atomic Fermi gas of ytterbium (173Yb) in a three-dimensional optical lattice. Besides the suppression of compressibility and the existence of charge excitation gap which characterize a Mott insulating phase, we reveal an important difference between the cases of SU(6) and SU(2) in the achievable temperature as the consequence of different entropy carried by an isolated spin. This is analogous to Pomeranchuk cooling in solid 3He and will be helpful for investigating exotic quantum phases of SU(N) Hubbard system at extremely low temperatures.},

abstract = {The transition from a few-body system to a many-body system can result in new length scales, novel collective phenomena or even in a phase transition. Such a threshold behavior was shown for example in 4He droplets, where 4He turns into a superfluid for a specific number of particles [1]. A particularly interesting question in this context is at which point a few-body theory can be substituted by a mean field model, i. e. where the discrete number of particles can be treated as a continuous quantity. Such a transition from two non-interacting fermionic particles to a Fermi sea was demonstrated recently [2]. In this letter, we study a similar crossover to a many-body regime based on ultralong-range Rydberg molecules [3] forming a model system with binary interactions.},

abstract = {Degenerate quantum gases of alkaline-earth-like elements open new opportunities in research areas ranging from molecular physics to the study of strongly correlated systems. These experiments exploit the rich electronic structure of these elements, which is markedly different from the one of other species for which quantum degeneracy has been attained. Specifically, alkaline-earth-like atoms, such as strontium, feature metastable triplet states, narrow intercombination lines, and a non-magnetic, closed-shell ground state. This review covers the creation of quantum degenerate gases of strontium and the first experiments performed with this new system. It focuses on laser-cooling and evaporation schemes, which enable the creation of Bose-Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases of all strontium isotopes, and shows how they are used for the investigation of optical Feshbach resonances, the study of degenerate gases loaded into an optical lattice, as well as the coherent creation of Sr{\_}2 molecules.},

This wave function is valid from intermediate to asymptotic internuclear distance over a large energy range near zero energy, and is especially suitable for cold and ultracold collisions. We have used this analytic wave function with the reflection approximation formula for calculating Franck-Condon factors for photoassociative spectroscopy. Numerical tests show very satisfactory agreement between the resulting analytic formula and the fully quantum numerical results in most cases investigated. Finally, we show in a model case that our analytical wave function enables us to relate the scattering length directly to a preasymp-totic node in the ground-state wave function, which in principle can be measured by photoassociative spectroscopy.

abstract = {Photoassociation is the process in which two colliding atoms absorb a photon to form an excited molecule. The development of laser-cooling techniques for producing gases at ultracold ($\backslash$textless1 mK) temperatures allows photoassociation spectroscopy to be performed with very high spectral resolution. Of particular interest is the investigation of molecular states whose properties can be related, with high precision, to the properties of their constituent atoms with the “complications” of chemical binding accounted for by a few parameters. These include bound long-range or purely long-range vibrational states in which two atoms spend most or all of their time at large internuclear separations. Low-energy atomic scattering states also share this characteristic. Photoassociation techniques have made important contributions to the study of all of these. This review describes what is special about photoassociation spectroscopy at ultracold temperatures, how it is performed, and a sampling of results including the determination of scattering lengths, their control via optical Feshbach resonances, precision determinations of atomic lifetimes from molecular spectra, limits on photoassociation rates in a Bose-Einstein condensate, and briefly, production of cold molecules. Discussions are illustrated with examples on alkali-metal atoms as well as other species. Progress in the field is already past the point where this review can be exhaustive, but an introduction is provided on the capabilities of photoassociation spectroscopy and the techniques presently in use.},

These resonances are promising for many-body physics experiments, yet the practical application of OFRs has been limited. The theory of OFRs has been based on an approximate model that fails in important detuning regimes, and the incomplete theoretical understanding of this effect has hindered OFR experiments. We present the most complete theoretical treatment of OFRs to date, demonstrating important characteristics that must be considered in OFR experiments and comparing OFRs to the well-studied case of magnetic Feshbach resonances. We also present a comprehensive treatment of the approximate OFR model, including a study of the range of validity for this model. Finally, we derive experimentally useful expressions that can be applied to real experimental data to extract important information about the resonance structure of colliding atoms.},

When the kinetic energy e of two colliding ground state atoms plus photon energy fi, {\~{}} of a tunable laser matches the energy difference between an excited bound level b and the asymptotic ground state energy, photoexcitation will result in level b, appearing as a scattering resonance. If the bound level decays to some product state p, which is detected as a function of A, {\~{}}, the resulting spectrum maps out the positions of the excited bound levels b. Because the thermal energy k{\&}T of trapped atoms is typically close to the natural linewidth of the atomic cooling transition, the high resolution photoassociation spectrum exhibits only slight thermal broadening. Using a Breit-Wigner resonance scattering treatment and assuming that the natural width y (in energy units) of the resonances was small compared to kBT, Thorsheim, Weiner, and Julienne obtained a thermally averaged spectrum for Na atoms at 10 mK. Since T (1 mK in magneto-optical trap (MOT) [2 — 4] and far off-resonance trap (FORT) [5] experiments, we present a new treatment of the line shapes for photoassociation spectra valid even when k{\&}T {\~{}} y. Recently, 1 MHz resolution line shapes have been reported for both Na [2] and Rb [5] photoassociative spectra.

Coupled channels theory provides the rigorous formulation of the microscopic physics of Feshbach resonances in cold gases. Concepts of dressed versus bare energy states, universal properties of Feshbach molecules, as well as the classification in terms of entrance- and closed-channel dominated resonances are introduced on the basis of practical two-channel approaches. Their significance is illustrated for several experimental observations, such as binding energies and lifetimes with respect to collisional relaxation. Molecular association and dissociation are discussed in the context of techniques involving linear magnetic field sweeps in cold Bose and Fermi gases as well as pulse sequences leading to Ramsey-type interference fringes. Their descriptions in terms of Landau-Zener, two-level mean field as well as beyond mean field approaches are reviewed in detail, including the associated ranges of validity.},

Nine least-bound vibrational molecular levels associated with the long-range 0u and 1u potential energy surfaces were measured and identified. A simple theoretical model accurately describes the level positions and treats the effects of the lattice confinement on the line shapes. The measured resonance strengths show that optical tuning of the ground state scattering length should be possible without significant atom loss.},

@article{Jones1999,
abstract = {We carried out the first experimental study testing an elasmobranchs ability to return home. We displaced juvenile lemon sharks, Negaprion bevirostris, 4–16 km from their observed home ranges at Bimini Islands, Bahamas during daylight and at night. We tracked all sharks except one back to the Bimini Islands and most returned to their home ranges observed before displacement. Even sharks displaced to a site closer to another island with suitable habitat for young lemon sharks returned to their home ranges at Bimini Islands. Sharks displayed a preferred compass direction (PCD) toward the east as their first swimming direction after release, suggesting an innate sense of direction. This bearing was followed shortly afterwards by a home-oriented direction. Swimming speeds prior to reaching shore were approximately twice as fast than the usual cruising speed reported for juvenile lemon sharks. The return of young (0–2 years), inexperienced sharks to their original home range indicate high site fidelity and an ability to home},
