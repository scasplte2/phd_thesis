two things I want to do

I need a brief overview of low energy scattering to motivate the scattering wavefunction

solution of the square step as a way to connect the classical statistical mechanics of a dilute gas to the quantum mechanical scattering-based solution to the lineshapes

oh myu friggin lord I havbe been struggling with this for such a long time. Why can't I just get y thoughts together? It is so infuriating.



what is the conclusion I want to have at the end of chapter three?
I want the reader to know that PA dis concerning the scattering wavefunction, that it comes from the overlap integral of the tweo wavefunctions (why do I need to know this? nbecause this means that it is sensitive to positions of the nodes and can be used to map out the potentials

lshort summary of my chapter three conclision
pa depends on the interatomic potential and the energy of the constituent atoms

chapter three is where I need to introduce K with the simple version of f(p_

what about writing K witht the center of mass frame?
	that is a comploication I can figure out later
	
	what is the organization of chapter three?
	intro - what can PA be used for? what is it's general purpose, why not just follow the model of the friggin jones review here
	
	vaguelyu talk abotut PA and how it works and give a sim[ple picture but don't discuss any of the phjysics
	
	ok so I want something like
	intro
	theoreitcal description
		basic scattering
		modifying interactions aka field dressed theory
		connect that to the PA model
		
		what is my segfue from the full quantum treatment to the closed analytic forms? - this is the BJ argument
		
		I am so tired of sitting here struggling with this. I am foinf rto fet this done. I will not fail. I WILL NOT FAIL at this. FUCK
		
		stop being so nihilistic. You will get this done, you just have to stop being so lazy and stopp wringing your hands. You know what needs to be written. You know how to present things to people. It is really not that griggin hard to throw together something mediocre and just get it done. You aren't going into academia so you just need to satidy Randy and move on with your life. You can and will do this. We are in this together
		
		ok
		
		I want to incorporate the descriptthe ideal description
		
		
		that is what I want chapter three to be, it needs to be the ideal simple description of all these processes so that I can make them more complicated later in 4 and 5
		
		ok, so move the experimental details to chapter 4 for sure.
		
		how do I organize the rest of the chapter?
		
		umm.....
		
		how to connect the has description in the trap to the pa process?
		
		I also want to get this done so I can impress sam and sa\tart living my life again.
		
		ok
		
		
		ok, so develpo the simple theory showing the contributions from the different thermal energies
		
		Realizing photoassociation using ultracold fases?
		
		j,,..... dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd

################
Def need to figure out the general experimental method section
	start by combining the two sections from the two papers
	then talk about the implementation specifics to achieve
	
For ch 4 and 5 perhaps the section should be experimental considerations, or 
	ch 4 - local trap depth
	ch 5 - something to do with scanning the laser the wrong way

###
Collisional wavefunction notes
###			
consider the two particle system as a single entagled particle
	long range part of this quasi-particle is just the eigenstates of the separate particles themselves (only composed of two parts)
	but the short range part is going to be determined by some complex physics (new eigenstates, what is the coupling mechanism?)
		the vdW point is the boundary distance?
		coupling is due to the interatomic potential, there is at least the long-range part falling off as R6, what are the types of interactions which make up the internal wall?


Think I want to introduce the photoassocation by talking about the collisional wavefunction

what will that do?

I want to build up ideas about the FCF and need the wf for that
	to get qf I have to go back to scattering theory

ideas of the wavefunction become that basis for how you want to talk about interacting potentials


free atoms
scatering as single particle state (differnet eigenstate)
	interaction determined by some gnarly stuff
From scattering theory we know that the long range behavior is determined by short range physics
	how do we know this? (the dalibard intro)
Can we come up with good enough pseudo potentials to describe the short range physics and then solve the schrodinger equation to extract wavefunctions?
	we want wavefunctions because that is the full characterization
	we don't know the right eigenbasis for the short range part but we can make some guesses (in particular Hund cases setup eigen states for various possible internal states)
	Bohn and Julienne theory guessed based on using quantum defect theory
		this pre-supposes that the bound and free wavefunctions are similar (I forget in what respect) but that the bound ones must go to zero as R->Inf
If we have some notion of the wf then we can construct matricies which define interactions once we add additional coupling to the scattering problem


now in a position where I need to connect scattering theory and the PAS


Once we have the ground state wavefunction of our new particle we can construct the internal structure by considering the internal energy strucutrue of the constituent atoms
	Can I make a connnection that since it is a composite particle we must consider all the various configurations available?

2019.03.14
--------------------------------
I was trying to figure out what subsections to use for introducing the experimental methods section in ch 4. 
Keys pooints to make are that we used our apparatus mostly but for the low intensity halo 
I think I would like to discus

lets see I will have already discussed the neutral apparatus and in this part I just need to talk about the AOM setup and the frequency stuff
	basically figure 2 from the paper
So.   uhhhhh
	We used this same setup on the rudnerh apparatus. The biggest difference was the optical dipole trap was a single beam trap instead of our normal crossed trap. This did leave to differences in the density and thermalization and so on
	
	Ok so present the PA setup and the basic sequence then talk about the trap
	
	
	
	progression would be like
	sequence
	
	no no
	
	rather,
	
Ecperimental methods
	expeeriments in this chapter adn the following are very similar. biggest scientific differnece is that we explored different regimes of intensity
	experiments in this chapter were done on rydberg apparatus
		nearly identical machine to ours 
			sample prep is the same but they have different ODT configurations
			specifics of general trapping procedure and characteristics can be found in some location
		used the PA light from my apparatus coupled through a long fiber
			pa generation talked abot below
		For the low E exp the general parameters were such and such
	generic timinf diagram (denote where physics is different)
generation of photoassociation light
Specifics of the low e experiment
	discuss optical setup
		propagation, polarization
	B field?
	ODT configurartion
		consideration of the trap depth
			during experiment we took a lot of data over a wide range of parameters and asumed we were in a deeply trapped regime
				took data all the way down at 30nK and thought it was normal to not have a BEC at this point because it is 86
			determined trap frequencies after we did the experiment
			during analysis we found a problem with the model not agreeing
				30nK data did not fit well if we made the typical assumptions about a deep trap
				show plot of fit
			decided to model the trap numerically
				trap frequencies were measured at higher temps and extrapolated using model (reason to believe modeling)
			modeling found that the lowest point of the trap was an odd trajectory and was much lower than we naively thought
				show plot of fit
				hypothesized that the sample may not have been thermalized completely (non-ergodic) and thus was fooling us
				this is supported by the better fitting of 30 nK data over time
			Brings into questions the use of temperature, but will persist with that data where there is at least reaonsable agreement
			Leads to a strong modification of the momentum distribution and will effect the energy integral due to large variation in the available energy range
			
------------------------------------------------------------
Not sure where to get the isotropy from
	there is 

			
Clasical collisions
Quantum qutructured particle in free space
	kinetic energy basis used to describe
Adding r-dependent interaction potential
Multi-channel extension
