ok, I apologize for this but I need to vent. Please disregard...

I can't believe how far I've gotten in atomic physics without fundamentally understanding scattering. Of course I could always rattle off the equations I read in texts and mimic their arguments to sound like I knew what was going on, but it is a friggin travesty that only now (in writing my phd thesis!!) do I "get it". It is like all of a sudden this scary ass thing that seemed overly complex and filled me with dread has just clicked and I see it. On one hand I am so relieved that I will be presenting something I understand and not hoping to get tripped up, but on the other, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN!! Why wasn't I forced to confront this before? Why was I allowed to continue on with this HUGE gap in what is a very basic component of what I do? Ahh... it is so frustrating. I feel to blame honestly, maybe if I was a better student or more motivated I would have understood this a long time ago (like when I was taught it) but the fact is I did figure it out (albeit right before it is damn near useless to me).
This is a perfect encapsulation of my time in grad school. The illusion of intelligence. Projected by way of hand waving arguments, fancy words, and over complex design. Everyone seems content, or is forced, to struggle through the morass of ignorance and needless complexity because result have to be gotten. Tom doesn't care about giving us the time to learn things on our own and to struggle with stuff until we find it. I've had to teach myself so much because he improperly manages his students and doesn't give his labs the resources needed so his students can actually understand what they are trying to do. He doesn't care if you are just a trained monkey, as long as you do what he wants and produce data so he can understand it, interpret, and tell you what to do next. God friggin' forbid he schedule time on the front-end to think through problems and develop the tools needed to make informed decisions during the project.
I am so jaded by this experience. I wouldn't ever want to give up what I've gained through this process but I am infuriated by the possibility that it could have been so much more.
